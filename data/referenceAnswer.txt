The Whorfian hypothesis states that the language one speaks determines or heavily influences the thoughts one can think or the saliency of different categories of thought. There are two versions of the Whorfian hypothesis. The weak form says that when a language contains many refined descriptions of specific concepts, then you can also think in more sophisticated ways. This is also called linguistic relativism. The strong form says that language limits us in what and how we can think. This is also called linguistic determinism. Most modern language experts agree upon the weak, but not the strong version of the Whorfian hypothesis.
