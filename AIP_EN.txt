Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory says that language limits our thinking. You can’t think about something that you don’t know any words for. There is a strong and a weak variation of the theory. \n The strong one says that you literally can’t think about something that you don’t know any words for and the weak variation states that you can still think about processes or things you couldn’t express in words but you cant think about them as explicit as you could if you would know the words. \n\n Experts believe more in the weak than in the strong variation.

The Sapir-Whorfian Theory has two parts, the strong and the weak form. The weak form says that you can think in a more sophisticated way when you have more words included in your language that express these thoughts. You can describe your thoughts in more detail than people who do not have as much words to express their thoughts than you. \n The strong form of the theory says that if you do not have these words you cannot think properly. \n\n Scientists agree on the weak form of the theory but not on the strong form.

Antwoord: The Whorfian language theory is the proposal that language determines or highly influences the thoughts one has. It can be understood that language shapes the way we are thinking. \n\n The weak hypothesis \n\n Language influences thought, languages facilitates thoughts. /n The more words we know in our vocabulary the better we are able to refine our thoughts, the better we are able to think in more sophisticated ways. \n\n The strong hypothesis \n\n Languages determines thought! It can be seen as “Language “dictates” what we think. In easier words: The less words we know the less we are able to think ? the more “stupid” we are.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is separated into a strong and a weak variation. \n While most scientists agree with the weak variation, the strong version of the theory has quite some scientists critizing it. \n\n The weak version of Whorf’s language theory states that our lack of words for some feelings/emotions/stimuli/… inhibits our thinking. In contrast to the strong version of the theory it states that a lack of language is not the only reason why our thinking is limited. \n\n\n The strong version of Whorf’s language theory states that our thinking is strictly limited by our limited number of words we know. \n For example it is not possible for us to describe colors only because we have no real words for that.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory contains the association of language and thinking. The theory says that language influences the thoughts of people. One point is that the variations of your thoughts depends on the richness of your vocabulary. Also culture and, thus, the way you use language, influences thinking. The reason of culture is a strong point if you consider heuristic. What is common in your culture or what categories are there. A weak variations is that dept have thoughts as well! Some of them learn sign language but some of them not. In this case it is hard to consider the whorf’s language theory.

Antwoord: Whorf compared the Inuit language with the English language. He first found out that the Inuit language has 300 different terms for the words snow (ice, slush etc.). He then concluded that the Inuit have such a good distinction between different snow types because of their richness of vocabulary. He found out that this asumption was wrong. Actually the English language has more terms for snow. He there for concluded that the Inuit have a better distinction because of their daily experience with snow. They have a greater need for this distinction. Whorf also made the hypothesis that language limits our thinking and doing. This is called the “weak theory”. Other psychologist don’t agree with his last hypothesis (weak theory). They often put up a strong theory, which says that language supports and strengthens our thinking and doing.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is about the fact, that or if ‘language influence the way/fastness of our thinking’ \n\n There are three different answers to that. Some people/psychologyst disagree \n a lot saying it is partial true, and just a view agree on it. \n\n Not Agree with the hypothesis: \n The german word ‘fingerspitzengefühl’ just exists in this language and means that somebody is accurate and is doing his/her’s exercise very well. \n But this does not mean that in other countrys there are no people living with this special attitudes. This is a weak variation. \n Agree \n Inuits, for example have six different words for snow. The snow which is falling down, fluffy one, one hard and ice-like snow. Europeans do also know this kinds of snow, as I just proved while describing it. So European need longer to describe the sorts of snow While Inuits just saying the specialized name for it and everyone knows what the person talks about \n Partially agree \n This is supported by the most scientists. Means that Europeans have the colour blue & green, but no word for a combination of it, while some African tribs have a special word for it. So describing the word makes it way harder for Europeans than for people from Afrika. This is a strong variation of words using between the citizens.

Antwoord: The (Saphir)-Worphian hypothesis tries to answer the question whether people with different languages think differently. \n It’s the proposal that the language one speaks heavily influences and determines the thoughts we are able to think and the concepts of our thoughts. \n The weak form, on which most language experts agree, is the proposal that when a language contains many refined thoughts and concepts of thoughts, one is thus able to express oneself in a more sophisticated way. \n In other words: if you know a lot of words, you can express yourself in an adequate and differentiated way. \n A good example for this is the tribe of the Inuits who have a very refined concept for the word “snow” as the environment shaped their language. Thus, they can speak in a very sophisticated way about snow. The strong variation of this hypothesis says that language really limits our thoughts or if you can’t speak well, it limits you.

Antwoord: The strong Whorf’s language theory states that language determines our thinking. So we can only think what we could express, nothing more. Evidence for that theory is shown in tribes that live in deserts and which do not have a higher number than three. If a researcher claps more than three times in theye hand the tribe-member would not clap the same amount and would clap three times. \n The weak Whorf’s language theory states that language has a big influence on thinking but do not fully determine it. Everybody had experienced at some point evidence for it, when we had a “feeling” or idea we could not express in words but still had the concept in mind. Even in language is evidence for it. For example German (and Dutch) people use the word “Schadenfreude” to express the pleasure of someone elses failiour and even if in English or Spanish there is no word for it English and Spanish people are familiar with this (mean) type of pleasure. Today hardly anyone believes in the strong version anymore and the weak version is “acepted” all over in the scientific sociaty (even Whorf himself does not believe in the strong version anymore).

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory refers to the importance of language in our daily life. It can be divided into the strong and the weak variation. The weak version assumes that we need our language to determine certain facts, situations etc. but that – although sometimes we cannot express something or do not know words in some cases – those things still exist. One example for that described weaked version could be a father of an indigenous family who only knows to count til three but who has 5 children actually. If he then says “many” instead of 5 (because he does not know how to express that) he still has those 5 children and he knows that. \n The strong variation in contrast simply reduces everything on language. So things that we cannot express by using language simply do not exist or at least our knowledge does not exist because language is “everything”, from perception to expression. Things you cannot express, cannot be perceived. \n\n The theory also refers to the differences between languages and cultures. Some languages have – because of their culture and typical food with certain spices – much more specified vocabulary for describing very specific tastes. Whereas other cultures differ in other aspects which they then have more specified vocabulary for. \n But only very few people support the strong theory whereas the weak variation is more “used”.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that language influences thinking/cognition. \n There are two types of Whorf’s language theory: weak and strong. \n The strong theory states that language comes before thinking. That means that people are not intelligent without language. For example an African tribe don’t distinguish between the colour blue and green. In their language they have only one word for the two colours. If you ask them what the difference between the two colours is, they don’t know because they don’t distinguish blue and green. The weak theory states that language has only an influence on thinking/cognition. An example for this theory is, that the Inuits have a lot of words which describe various types of snow. They have a more intelligent way of thinking about snow than other people.

Antwoord: Whorfians language theory states that the language someone speaks influences the way this person thinks. \n A strong position in this theory is that the language someone speaks influences the way someone interprets for example situations. This would mean that all Chinese people have a completely different way of thinking then for example Dutch people. A weaker variation of this theory is that because some languages have more words for a special topic they seem to have a different way of seeing it. For example Inuits have more then hundred words to describe snow while in the english language there are not more than maybe fifteen words for snow. But this fact could be explained on the different living situations, Inuits live in snowy areas and therefore think more and experience more with snow. \n Another point that needs to be thought about people which speak more languages and if that means they are different to people which only speak one language. To conclude the Whorfians language theory is a really big statement while there is not much prove for it.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis or Whorf’s language theory referes to the relationship of language and thinking. \n The weak version of this hypothesis states that our language limits our way to express thinking. Therefore we think more than we are able to say. For example you have a word on the tip of your tounge. You know what it is but you cannot pin-point it. \n The strong version states that the amount of vocabulary dominates your thinking, meaning that people with a rich amount of vocabulary are able to think more abstract, detailed and reasonable than those with less vocabulary.

Of course it is clear that we only can think in words we know and can only express feelings and emotions with the vocabulary we have, which is the strong variation of the theory. Otherwise is there the inverted spectrum. It consists of thoughts or feelings, which are indescribable. This might be the weak variation of the theory, because in this position, the thoughts seems to be independent from the language.

Antwoord: The strong version of the Whorfian hypothesis states that language shapes our way of thinking. \n This hypothesis is a highly discussed topic. \n Many critisists state, that there are many people that speak multiple languages and that it could not be possible that these people have a thinking pattern shaped by every single language they speak. However, they admit, that language has a correlation with culture and that certain words in one language simply do not exist in another. So wanting to express something with words you know that are simply not existant in another language limits your way of communication. This is why some people go with the weak version of Whorf’s hypothesis. It purposes, that language does have an influence on thought, but not in the amount that it would determine the way of how an individual thinks. He could for example no langer differentiate between hundreds of terms for the word “snow” as in some innuite languages, but he himself, would still have his individual perception of snow and its varieties. Being raised bilingual, I personally think that language does “shape” the way you think in a way and more that it gives you the opportunity to have a broader and more open mind for different views on problems.and for the acquisition of beliefs and knowledge.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory indicates that we can only think of something what is a word and we are thinking in words. \n The weak variation of the theory says that language can influence our thinking patterns, based on these different cultures. But besides that we can also think in pictures, feelings etc. which don’t play a role in language. \n The strong theory indicates that we can’t think of anything what doesn’t have a word. For example in another language the English word snow has a lot of different words for the type of snow. According to this theory it means that they can distinguish and experience these different types of snow and people who don’t know these words don’t. That’s the only way how you know the difference, by language differenciation. \n Part of the weak theory can be true. People can have different personalities and the cultures can strongly influence the way you are thinking, but thoughts can even have pictures, feelings and we can’t always express ourselves in words. language doesn’t provide the words for it. That’s why introspection can be difficult. I believe that we can also think without language.

Antwoord: The whorfain Hypothesis is about the influence of language on thinking. This theory consists of two versions. The strong and the weak one. The old one (strong version) is understood to be false. even the researchers themselfs rejected the strong version. But the weak one has some evidence to be true. \n The strong version is about “language determinism.” which means that our thinking is determind or contained by our language. Said differently, we can only think what we can put in words. \n Howevery, this is prooven to be wrong. Therefor the researchers have suggested a weak version, which is about “language relativity”. This version states that language has an influence on thinking but does not determine or contrain it. Evedence has prooven this to be true. If we have a look at “grue languages” we can observe that some peoples don’t make a distinction between blue and green in their language but perceive them has two different colours. Another example are some peoples in Australia who only make a distinction between one and many in their language. For instance, if a father is asked about how many chirldren he has he will answer “many”. Asked again, he states all of childrens names and draws four lines into the sand and says again “many”.

Antwoord: Whorf’s theory of language states that language is the framework for thinking. In order to truly understand the world it is necessary to have the ‘vocabulary’. The strong variation of the theory supports the idea that we are limited in our thinking if we are not able to define things. Moreover the high intellectual kind of thinking, that only the human species is capable of, is based on abstract things. In order to grasp philosophical theories, or structures of molecules it is necessary to receive the sensory stimuli through language. The weaker variation of the theory includes the fact that  language is a form of communicating needs, events or ideas. As children who have grown up isolated and overcome the sensitive stage of learning show is language needed. A person who is not able to live in a special desirable way limited in their language skills tends to be les fulfilled. Proof of this can be found in the Indian boy who died after living with humans for a while. Whereas the girl that was able to learn the language had the chance to start a life integrated into society.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is about the interaction/connection between thinking and language. \n In the strong variation of this theory he states that thinking is not possible without the ability to speak. So language would be crucial for thinking. But the more modern views are more likely to support the weak variation. This variation of the theory suggests that if we have a wide spread, good vocabulary, we can also think in a more sophisticated way. With language we can express our thoughts and share them with others. \n We all know situation, I which we ‘know’ something/know what we are thinking about, but we are limited in expressing our thoughts. So I believe the weak version of the Whorf theory is a good way to look at the relationship between thinking and language. Modern research have shown that thinking is still possible, even if you’re not able to speak, so the strong version of the theory is kind of ‘overruled’ by now.

If a language does not provide two different words for similar or at least two different things, the theory suggest that one can also not recognise a difference in his or her mind.

The weak variation agrees that it has an influence but only in more minor cases and that this phenomenom does not result in huge differences among the thinking between different language groups. In modern psychology the weak variation is more often seen as true. There are case where a difference according to the theory are present but big differences in the way of thinking have yet to be observed. Everyday communication between cultures are also for example a sign that the weaker theory is closer to reality

Antwoord: The Whorfian’s hypothesis exposes the influence of languaege on thinking. \n The weak theory states that an increase in knowledge of language (for example words) helps to express your thinking (thoughts). As an example: I imagine and apple. I have now a large vocabulary (green, red, small, big, granny’s smith, shaddow, worm). With this knowledge I can express my mental image better than by just saying its an apple. \n Most scientists agree to this theory (weak). \n\n The strong theory states, that, the knowledge of language limits the thinking. So if you know more words you can think more. \n As an example, you can’t think of a computer and all it’s parts if you don’t know the words (motherboard, mouse, screen, button). \n I and the most scientists don’t agree to the strong variation of the theory because of your imagination. You still can imagine fantasy animals with body parts where you don’t have a name or a meaning for. \n\n An important philosoph about language and thinking is Ludwig Wittgenstein with his work (Tractatus logicus philosophicus) where he explains the relationship between language and thinking.

Antwoord: Whorfian’s hypothesis says that thinking depends on language. By thinking he means grasping concepts, understanding them, remember them and fully knowing what is meant. \n There are two variations of it. The strong one says strictly that one cannot think (understand, perceive, …) an entity without language – without having a word for it and knowing this word. Which means that one’s thinking is determined and restricted by words (language). \n\n The weak variation hypthesyses that one can think (understand, remember more easily) a certain concept better, if one has a word for it. Which means that knowing the word for an entity supports understanding, remembering and distinguishing it from other (similar) entities. But it does not implement, that the use of language/words is crucial for thinking. Examples like mental representation show that we can also think beside the use of words.

Antwoord: There is a strong version and a weak version of whorf’s language theory. The strong version states that language determines or strongly constrains our way of thinking. That means if we don’t have a word for it we also don’t have a concept for it. Nobody, not even Whorf himself believes in the strong version anymore. Because there are ways of thinking which work without words. For example we don’t have a word to describe the taste of chocolate but we have a concept for the taste of chocolate. Or in the corean language there is no difference between “on” (touching the ground) and “above” (not touching the ground). But of course Koreans know the difference between these concepts despite not having a word for it. Otherwise I would never go with a Korean airline. \n The weak version of Whorf’s language theory states that language influences but doesn’t fully determine our way of thinking. There is evidence supporting this theory. Researchers conducted a study with grue language speakers. In a grue language there is no difference between “green” and “blue”. The participants got a bunch of blue and green chips and they had to sort it. Non-grue-language speakers discriminated between the colour green and the colour blue. However grue-language-speakers used different techniques like making discrimination on the brightness of the chips.

Antwoord: According to the (Sapir-)Whorfian language theory, there is a strong relation between a population’s language specifically, how sophisticated and well-developed it is) and intellectual capacities. \n There are two variations of this theory. \n The strong Whorfian hypothesis suggests that a human’s language not only supports and increases his intellect, but also limits it: The basic principle is “If you don’t have a word for it” or “If you cannot describe the difference between two things (in words), then you do not differentiate between these things in the first place”. However, this version of Whorf’s theory is widely rejected. \n The weak variation of the theory, in contrast, focuses on the concept that a human’s language has a “supporting” effect on his ability to think and reason: The more elaborate and sophisticated one’s language is (e.g. in terms of vocabulary or complexity), the greater one’s intellectual capacities are, that is, the more sophisticated one’s thinking, reasoning and self-expression is. This version of the Whorfian hypothesis is generally accepted by language theorists and scientists.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory considers the relation between language and thinking. His weak variation of the theory states that every language has its own concepts and structures and we humans can think with these structures in more sophisticated ways. This variation is the more common explanation for the language and thinking debate. \n Whorf’s strong theory however indicates that language limits our thoughts. That means according to this variant the human cannot think at all without any language. \n It is critical to confirm the strong theory because we indeed have thoughts about feelings, smells or mental images we probably cannot express in words. Whorf’s weak theory includes true aspects, because we humans use our language to express thoughts. Structures and a big vocabular helps us to say things more detailed. So if we describe for example a chair it is better to know words about the size, colour, function and material than just use a limited known words about the colour of a chair. Furthermore if we learn a word in our language in a certain context we are indeed able to use it in other contexts as well. For instance if we use “red” in terms of a red pen we might also use “red” to describe a red chair as well. \n Therefore there is indeed a relation between thinking and language and I think it can be confirmed that language can influence our thoughts.

Antwoord: The strong Whorfian hypothesis claims that if a person has a more extensive vocabulary, it can go further in its way of thinking, since he or she will not lack the words to describe or understand certain thought processes. The weak variation of the theory is that language influences your perception and way of thinking. This would for example mean that humans that speak a language in which green and blue has the same name, would not be able to distinguish between the colors. This however is only partially true, since the people would be able to distinguish the colours but would see the difference between them more as a fluent transition. \n So in general Whorf’s theory explains some of our ways of thinking and even parts of perception, with differences in languages.

Antwoord: Whorf’s languag theory is that language is crucial for thinking. This would mean, that people who speak different languages would also think differently. This is strengthened with the fact that some languages contain words that don’t exist (have no translation) in others. \n But the theory is weakened with the fact that some languages have different associations within their word, but they mean the same thing. An example for this would be the word “screw driver” and the German word “Schraubenzieher” (“screw puller”), so the association is different for the same object and that doesn’t mean, that English and Germans think different. A strong variation of the therory would be that if you have a very large vocabulary, you probably are able to think in a more complex way. A weak variation would be that we can’t always express our thoughts in a sufficient way, for example if we think about a particular person or event that caused feelings and emotions, we are often unable to find the “right” words to express/explain this. This leads to the conclusion, that language is important for thinking and takes a large part in it, but thinking is also possible without the ability to speak or understand language.

Antwoord: The Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis describes the influence of languag on thoughts and cognition. Two variations of this language, the weak and the strong variation exist. \n The strong variation assumes that a person’s cognition is defined by the language that he or she speaks. Concepts that do not have a word they can be defined with, cannot be thought about. This, in turn, influences perception as perception is heavily influenced by our language. Perception is thought about and if we do not have the ability to give a name to a certain object (because the language spoken simply does not have a word for it), we cannot think about it. The (negative) effect on the cognition is shown. \n\n The weak variation describes the influence language has on thinking. Concepts we have a word for, again, in the language we speak, are more easily thought about and evaluated. \n Also, the structure of the languae can influence the way people think. In a study, a picture of a woman walking was shown to participants with different native languages. The backround of the picture showed a row of parked cars. The way, e.g. german and english speakers described what the woman was doing, shows the influence of language on thought. English speaker only decribe the action itself (“she is walking”) whereas german speakers describe the action in combination with a goal (‘she is walking towards a car’). \n Today, the weak variation of the hypothesis is favoured.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory assumpts that language influences our ways of thinking. \n There are a strong form and a weak form of the hypothesis: most modern researchers agree on the weak form but not on the strong form. \n The weak form says that language influences our perception of the world and our way of thinking. To illustrate, the distinctions of colour perceptions different languages make influence our perception. While russians make a distinction between dark blue and light blue, other languages make other distinctions or restrictions on colours. \n\n The strong form in contrast says that language limits and determines our way of thinking. It says that language shapes the culture, but it is more logical to say that the culture or the environment shapes the language. For example, just because inuits have a lot of snow-related words, does not mean that they are because of their language more able to make these fine distinctions than others with different languages, it simply means that their environment forces them to use all of these different terms. \n People with different language would be able to make the same distinctions, if they would need to. \n To conclude, language can influence our thinking but does not limit our thoughts.

Whorfian found out that they had a lot words to describe the different conditions of snow. \n But surprisingly later research found flaws in his results. For instants the English language has even more words for describing snow, although there are Americans who live in areas where it is never snowing. \n This leads to the conclusion that not words (language) defines the way of thinking (thoughts) about things, but the experience does. \n Another example for the weak variations of the theory is that people who suffer from Wernicke’s aphasia are perfectly able to have complex thoughts, but are not able to express them in language.

In other words, having a greater vocabulary, for instance, provides us with the opportunity to have more sophisticated thoughts. According to the weak variant, thought also contain emotions etc. \n Support for the weak variant would be, that we are sometimes not able to write down, what we are thinking exactly. Thus, thinking is not equal to language. Also, if the strong variant would be true, Wernicke’s aphesia patients would not be able to think due to their inability to create meaningful language. But, in fact, they are able to think in a way that makes sense to them. \n Additionally, people who cannot in terms of language discriminate certain differences are nevertheless able to detect them. Their differentiation would be more linear, whereas people that have two or more words for the differences would detect them in a more stair-wise manner. \n People who have clear differences in language for differences in stimuli might be more prepared and sophisticated in detecting and describing the differences, but those who do not have the linguistic differences are, however, not viable to do the same.

Antwoord: You can seperate the Whorf’s language theory in two variations of the theory. The strong version indicate that language limits or give the boundries for our thinking. The weak version says that language influence our thinking in certain ways. There are some evidences that the strong variation is true, because there are for example words like in german “Fingerspitzengefühl” with no explicit translation into other languages. In this case language defittaley limits your thoughts, because you can not express what you really want to express, because there is no term for the word in the other language. But many researchers also conclude that this form of the theory can not be true,. There is for example an african stam who has the same term for red and blue, but they can clearly identify each colour, although they have the same term for both. So not only because you can not put differrences into words, does not mean that this limits your way of thinking. That is also the reason why most of reseacher say that the strong version is not true, but they can identify themselves with the weak version. You could also say that the theory in general is partly true, because it is sometimes difficult to understand what people from foreign countries want to tell you and you therefore have a delayed resone.

There exist several forms of thinking without language: smell \n feeling & emotions \n mental imagery \n So the weak version says that language only to a certain point determines thinking.

Antwoord: The strong variations of the Whorf’s language theory says that language shapes our thinking. Meaning that without language we are not able to think. Without language we are not able to express our thoughts. Certain cultures have more words for specific terms because they are confronted with it everyday. Other cultures on the other hand don’t have that many words because they don’t need them. The strong theory says these people have an increased variance of thinking than those not using all these words. The weak theory says that depending on where you live and grew up you either need certain words or not but may developed other words that they needed and other cultures did not. \n\n The weak variation of the Whorf’s language theory says that language and perception is shaped by culture and it’s environment. We are indeed able to think even without language which can be seen in newborns. Newborns can’t express their feelings and thought in language yet because they haven’t learned it but they are still able to solve litte problems, think and come up with strategies. In certain cultures only the numbers 1 and two are known, 2 meaning more than one. They can still think, make plans, solve problems which indicate that language does not shape our Thoughts. Language only helps us increase our knowledge about certain things.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is stated in a hypothesis which has two different versions. \n The strong version refers to the linguistic determinism, stating that language determines what we think about us and the world. People don’t believe in this hypothesis anymore and even Whorf himself doesn’t. \n In contrast, the weak variation is about linguistic relativity. It states that language does influence our thoughts and what we think about the world but it does not determine it. \n For this variation there is evidence and people believe in it. An example one might could state is about grue-language. In grue-language, speakers don’t distinguish between the colors blue and green. \n When asked to describe objects showing these colors, grue speakers use different methods as hue or brightness to distinguish them. Non grue-speakers instead just name the object by its color. \n This example illustrates that language facilitates our thoughts but it just does not determine them as the first variation of Whorf’s theory attempted to predict.

Antwoord: Whorfian theory of language states that our thoughts are not only influenced by our native language, but completely shaped by it. This theory explains that if your native tongue doesn’t have a word to name a particular object, event, state or action, you won’t be able to recognize it in the world. As an example of this theory, some languages don’t have different words for the colors “green” and “blue”, and as a consequence, people raised with this language as mother tongue have great difficulties, or are simply unable to tell apart both colors. The strong variation of Whorf’s theory claims that without language, thinking processes are impossible. The weak variation of this theory, however, believes in the possibility of no language-related thinking processes, but still defends the great importance of language in how broad, complex and deep our thoughts can be.

Antwoord: The Sapir-Whorfian theory discusses the association between language and thinking. The theory has a strong and a weak version. \n The weak version of the theory states that language enhances thought. Although it does say that language is a way of expressing our thoughts and variations in vocabulary can enrich the depth of thought, it does not say that thought can not exist without language. In other words, there are thought or concept on the world that we can have or experience without necessarily having the language to express it. It is everything that goes through our minds that we “simply cannot find the words for”. \n The strong version of the theory states that thought cannot exist without language: If we cannot verbalize it, then we cannot think it. Similarly, if we do not have the words for a certain concept, we cannot think about that particular concept. An example here would be the taste of “umami”, which is usually associated with proteins. Everyone would be able to describe the general taste of protein, but without having the word for it, we cannot recognize and differentiate it as an individual taste.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis says that language highly influences thinking. Language determines our mental capacities and determines what can be thought about. Another part of the language theory is, that this is also visible in the vocabulary that exists in a language about an idea/concept. \n It is shown that this is not true though, because for example inuits do not have more words for snow than other languages. \n It also can be distinguished between the strong Whorfian hypothesis that clearly says that language determines thout and mental capacities. \n In the weak variation of the theory is is stated that language rather facilitates than determines thinking. The language can help and faciliate to adequately speak about thoughts. But there can be other reasons as well and there are thoughts that do not implement language. \n Most researchers agree on the weak variation of the theory. So the hypothesis that language helps facilitate thinking but doesn’t determine it. \n In the strong Whorfian hypothesis it is stated that language determines the thinking, so mental capacity. Also through the knowledge that the variing amount of vocabulary between languages for specific terms is not true or meaningful it is mostly agreed on the weak hypothesis. Meaning that language rather facilitates, helps our thinking.

Antwoord: The weak variation of the Whorfian hypothesis states that the more redefined a language is, the more you are able to express yourself and your thoughts in a sophisticated way as well, since you got more “possibilities”. The strong variation of Whorf’s theory is, that language determines and limits our thinking. \n The modern view only agrees with the weak form of the Whorfian theory. \n There are many other aspects of thinking, that work without language and therefore are not necessarly limited by it, - Mental imagery or feelings and emotions for example. \n Language must not shape our ideas (strong form) since we use language (which is universal) as a utility to express already existing thoughts, - to describe our environment for example. Some cultures are more in the need of an extended vocabulary for a specific theme to describe differences than other. ? Environment and culture shape our perception.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that our language influences and limits our way of thinking. \n\n The strong variation of this theory states that our language fully creates our way of thinking. Therefore we can not for example have mental processes about thinkgs we do not know the word for. This has the effect that our thought and concious processing is only limited by our language. \n This strong variation of the theory can be regardes with very little accuracy. \n One example could be the word “snow” in the culture of the inuits. These people have several different words for different kinds of snow. The strong theory would therefore claim that our culture could not distinguish different kinds of snow because we don’t have the words for them. However the reason because the inuits have different words for snow must have had the visual ability to distinguish snow beforehand creating words for it. \n The weak variation of the theory states on the other hand that language can indeed influence our thoughts but there are also different other aspects like visual imaginations that limit the influence of language. Deaf people who can’t read still visualize snow in the same way we do.

That the language heavily influence our thoughts. \n The weak variation of the theory says that language diterms us in a specific way. We are not so sophicticatet in what we think, if we do not have the words. \n The strong variation is in my opinion not true, because there native they have no different word for green and blue, but they can distinguish between these two colors. Or a other example is, there are natives they do not have more numberes than 3, but they are able to think about more number (eg. man has four children, he do not say four, but he know that he has more than 3 children). Our thought are not only influenced by ower language also from feelings, emotion, smell and other factors.

Antwoord: The Whorfian Hypothesis states that language influences thinking. Strong variations of this language theory state that without language humans would not be capable of thought. However this strong view of language has mostly been discounted because of its inability in evaluating unconscious processes which take place during language learning, such as how young children do not learn through imitation but rather the unconscious processing of syntax rules that sometimes leads to overregularisation. Soft variations of Whorf’s language theory state that language influences thinking however it is not the sole operator of thinking. Ultimately modern day scientists tend to draw the conclusion that both language and thinking shape environment and culture. Soft variations of the Whorfian Hypothesis do give allowance for the value of context in language and thinking. This is evident in many experiments such as one which asked participants to memorise the order of several soft toys. They were reorientated and asked to assemble the toys in the correct order. Those that had the words for left and right in their language organised the toys in relation to their left + right and created a mirror of the original. However those that only had the words for the compass positions organised the toys in relation to that. However they could also mirror the order when the question was framed different. Therefore both framing + context also played a role.

If our vocabulary is low, we are not able to think as specific as people, who have a large vocabulary. \n The stronger theory says, if we have no language, we have no opportunity to think. \n Most of the people who support this theory, are supporters of the weak theory, and not of the strong one. But there are also a lot of people, who do not support this theory. They say, also other senses like smelling or vision lead to thoughts. language is therfore not necessary.

Antwoord: The strong variation of Whorf’s language theory means that we (humans) can only think of and describe things that have words in our language. If there is no word for a certain thing, we can not imagine it or think of it which keeps us very limited in our perception and interpretation of the world. \n If we do not know a specific word, we can also not think or imagine this thing. \n Therefore, our imagination and ability to express ourselves is limited to our language and the words we know, which also shapes our perception and personality in a certain way. The weak variation, on the other hand, describes that we are not only shaped by language but also by everything else like our other sensory perception like seeing, feeling, smelling and hearing and furthermore, by our environment and culture. \n That means that our perception and thinking is not only limited to language but by all our senses and interpretations of the world.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory says that speech is influencing our way of thinking. A strong variation of the theory is for example that our native language gives us a different way of thinking than the native language of  a foreigner does, so that means that our way of thinking to other people on this earth (who have a different native language) is always different, because of different words, different grammar. This theory seems to be true because the way that we are thinking in, for example the grammar of our native language, is different to the grammar of french people.

Antwoord: The Sapir-Whorft or Whorfian hypothesis, states that language influences how we think. This hypothesis comes in two forms: the strong and the weak hypothesis. \n\n The strong hypothesis states that one’s thinking is limited by languge. This implies that it is impossible to think of something, if there is no word for it. \n\n The weak hypothesis states that one’s thinking is facilitated by languge. Language is, in this case, not a limiting factor but serves to retire the thinking proces. A greater vocabulary would thus ensure a more refined way of thinking. \n\n Although it is generally agreed upon that a greater vocabulary helps to distinguish and discriminate between experiences, the strong Whorfian hypothesis is rejected. The weak hypothesis is supported by the fact that aboriginal tribes have a greater difficulty distinguishing colours it they do not have the words for it. It is, however, not impossible for them to see the difference. \n Furthermore, the strong hypothesis is rejected for several experiences, such as emotion or smell, are universal and thus independent at language. \n To conclude, the weak Whorfian hypothesis that language facilitates thinking is supported. Yet, the strong hypothesis that language limits thinking is rejected.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis is concerned with the link or the relationship between language and thinking. The strong theory states that language completely determines our thinking, meaning that language forms the basis of all thinking and that we cannot possibly think beyond the boarders of language. According to that theory, language limits our thinking and we can only think with language. \n The weak theory states that language facilitates thinking, but it does not necessarily have to be the basis of all thinking. It states that if you have a rich vocabulary with many refined concepts and terms, this allows you to also have more distinguished and sophisticated words. Howwever, in contrast to the strong theory, the weak theory takes into account that there are also other modalities that can shape your thoughts. An example for this is mental imagery, or that you sometimes have feelings and emotions that you cannot put into words. This is why most psychologists favour the weak, but not the strong hypothesis, because a lot of people sometimes find themselves in situations where they have thoughts that are initially independent from language.

Antwoord: In general, the (Sapir-)Whorfian theory claims that terms and specific concepts at our language influence our way of thinking. \n The weak variation of the theory says that if a language contains many refined descriptions of specific concepts, we can think in a more sophisticated way. For example when a specific language contains many different descriptions of snow, our thoughts about it are more sophisticated and detailed. Falling snow can be distinguished from fallen snow and sticky snow from snow that resembles powder, and so on. \n In contrast, the strong variation proposes that our language directly determines how and what we think. This means, there is no thinking without the corresponding language. \n Experts generally agree with the weak variation of the theory but not with the strong variation. In fact, it has been discovered that aspects other than language can produce and develop thoughts meaning that language is not the one and only requirement for thinking.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s theory defines that language one’s speak can determine or heavily influence how an individual thinks. If you have a detailed language you have a larger spectrum of thoughts. For example the Inuits have many words for the term snow, because it is essential for them to survive. Different languages have different terms for colour or spatial places and direction. You can divide the theory into two variations. The weak variation state that language include details which causes that people can think in more details. The strong variation states that humans are restricted by language in the way they think the strong variation is often critizisied from researchers.

The strong form states that language directs our thoughts, meaning that if we do not have the words for it we are not thinking it. \n The weak form is more acepted than the strong one, as it has more proof. Sometimes we have certain feelings, but we don’t know how to put them into words. Another example is that we  don’t have a word for the taste of protein in the german language which does not mean we weren’t able to think about that taste before we learned the word umani for it.

Examples therefore are smell, emotions, feelings and mental imagery. \n In contrast, the strong variation of the Whorfian theory emphasizes that language determines thought. As a consequence, you can not think in a more sophisticated way than expressed through language. In one lecture, Mr. Dennis Schütter would go to far as to explain this strong variation through the statement: “If you can not express yourself properly, you are a stupid guy.” Nowadays, linguistics actually believe in the weak variation of the Whorfian hypothesis but the strong variation of his language theory is typically seen as incorrect as there is a lot of evidence against it.

Of course thinking in words cannot happen without language but there are other types of thinking, so as mental images or emotions, which don’t need words or can’t even be described in words; yet we are able to think them. Still, we must consider that most of our thinking is influenced through language, because things we want to discuss with other people and not just with ourselves, require language which again requires thinking in words.

Antwoord: In Whorf’s theory of language, words appear to shape our thoughts. In the strong variation of the theory, it is stated that a concept cannot be thought about without the proper vocabulary for it. If we do not know a word, then we cannot think about the concept that the word would normally describe. However, the more detailed and developed our vocabulary is about the concept, the more complex our thoughts can be about that specific concept and the more knowledge we would have about it. An example would be the Inuits and their detailed vocabulary about snow, which is thought to enable them to have much greater knowledge about snow types, and to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, the weak variation of the theory states that it is possible to think about a concept without knowing the word for it. Some words cannot always be translated from one language to another, and yet it does not mean that the concept does not exist among the people speaking the language in which the word cannot be translated. A common example would be the Dutch word “gezellig” which does not have a proper translation in, for example, English or French.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is basically his opinion that language limits thinking. In other words: no thinking without language. This extreme theory causes a lot of discussions. Many people refuse to believe this, for example bringing babies as an argument. It is proved that they think (showing brain activity) even if they don’t have words then. Another argument against Whorf’s theory is kind of a “patt”-situation: language doesn’t arrive out of nowhere, she has to develop but this seems impossible without thinking. On the other hand, thinking needs kind of a language, even if it is just an imagery language. Anyways there are strong and weak variations of the theory. In this term “weak” means just not that strict and general points of the Whorf’s language theory are respected in wide circles of academics.

Antwoord: According to the Whorforian language theory the ability to think is limited by the number of words a person speaks. That means that a person knowing more words can entertain broder thoughts and is more intellectual then a person knowing less vocabulary. The strong variation of the theory claims that the ability of thinking can be reduced to the number of known words. \n The weak variation claims that thinking can be improved by knowing more terms and enhance sophisticated thoughts, but thinking is not limited to the number of expressions known. \n The strong variation is not valid, because humans can also thinking without using languge containing words or language of dl. due to mental representation.

Antwoord: The Whorfian theory states, that we are only able to think in the categories dictated by our vocabulary (at least in the strong version). This is not true, due to the fact that we can think about concepts that have not been named yet and have feelings we can not verbally express. On the other hand the words we use are a way of sorting things and action, etc. into groups and guides our thoughts in a way, because it alters how we percieve the world. For example we treat a flower differently and assign it a different value, if we know it is not just some plant. Therefore the ‘weak’ Whorfian theory was build which states that our language does influence our thinking but not exclusively and that thoughts and ideas outside our vocabulary are possible.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory states that our thinking is regulated by our language. The strong variation of this theory states that thinking is regulated by the specific language someone speaks, while the weak variation says that the borders of thinking are the same for every language. \n I would say that thinking has borders, because of language, but that the typ of language doesn’t influence this borders. We can’t think about and understand some things, because we are not able to find words for it. In some situations we even can’t find words to descripe our experience, so our thinking is regulated by language. But I wouldn’t support the strong variation, because this would mean that if someone speaks several language he would think in different ways when using one language. I would say that not the specific languages regulates thinking, but the different cultural backgrounds. In the end are the different languages only a expression of the different cultural backgrounds.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory says that every language is unique and teaches us different parts of how we perceive and describe things and situations. Every language differs in the way of how people are thaught and the more sophisticated they are the more can thoughts be discribtive, because thoughts are made out of knowledge and language. This is the weak variation of Whorf’s theory. So the more educated someone is the more languages and parts of languages can be used, the more sophisticated the person can express theirself and the more thoughts can be formed. \n The strong variation says that people without this knowledge and skills are less sophisticated and more “dumb” than other because they are not able to form their thoughts the way other people can.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis claims a relationship between thinking and language. \n\n The strong version suggests that language sets constraints to thinking. \n Concluding that, if one doesn’t know a certain word, he also has no mental conceptualisation of it. There is empirical evidence supporting and relating this proposal. For example tribes who use a counting system of 1, 2, and many do bad at numeric tasks. Though I could assume that this is quite obvious. It’s like blaming a computer who uses a binary system, for being bad at octal, hexadecimal tasks (if you didn’t teach him). Inuits are said to have more words for snow and, the proposal is, therefore a different perception and distinction of snow, but recent studies refute this. It’s more like it developed from everyday-life. Nowadays the more accepted version is the weak one which says that language influences thinking but does not determine it. Evidence comes from studies of tribes that use east-west instead of left-right, and here they indeed perform according to an east-west thinking, where east is relative to where the sun goes up. \n When asked to place an object east side they adjust it accordingly. IN the end I think it might actually influence the way you understand terms, similar to an invented spectrum they have different terms to think in, but perception is equally possible for “every” healthy person. Just the categories you think in are different.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis consists of two theories. The weak theory states that when language consists of more defined words the thinking can be more sophisticated. For example if you or your language knows different types of bavarages it is easier to think of them as water, juice, liquor. Of course this hypothesis can be used for more complicated subjects as well. And most of the scientists do agree to this weak version. \n However the strong version states that language can influence the way we think. But when you tell people to think of a table most of the time each person thinks of a different type like a tea table or a small one next to your bed maybe even a table at school. Considering this language does not really influence how we think because everybody is thinking about a different kind of table.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory consists of two different theories. \n The first one is the strong version. According to this theory languge determines the way we do not have a concept of something when we do not have a world for it. The second theory is still discussed. It states that language influences our thoughts but does not fully determine the way we think. A lot of evidence proof this version. For example there are languages which have far more words for different kinds of smell. Therefore the native speakers are able to differentiate far more scents than for example english speakers. Important to say is that english speaker however are able to smell the differences but just do not notice it.

Antwoord: The (Sapir-)Whorfian theory is about lingustic relativity and discusses the influence of language on our thinking. There are two versions of this theory, the first one is the strong theory (Determinism), which includes the belief that language (lingustic ability) determines/constraints our thinking/behavior. \n The weak theory, whereas also supports the idea that language influences thinking but not to this extent, because, other things can also have an effect on our thoughts, e.g., smell, mental images, environment, culture, etc. Do people who grew up with different languges think differently? No, they do not. \n However, it can be said that language influences our thinking in several way. Imagine telling your friends the word “table”, every single one of them will probably think about another kind of table (e.g., coffee table, dining table, beer table etc.) Although the world “table” is really broad. (Support of strong theory.) But if you would ask an Eskimo or a person from India what a “coffee table” is, they would probibly can’t tell you, because this world simply doesn’t exist in their languge. As you can see laguge has its limits and can limit our ability to express our thoughts in many ways, although it can be said that it somehow has an influence on our thinking.

The strong variation of the Whorfian hypothesis is a more extreme opinion, basically stating that language determines how and what we can think.

Antwoord: There is a weak and a strong variation of the Whorf’s theory. \n\n The strong variation says that, our language determines our thoughts and what we think about the world. \n\n The weak variation says that, our language influence in some extent our thoughts and the view about the world, but not determine it completly. \n\n Comparing the two statements, the today’s view represent the the weak version. Researchers of language and experts also prefer the weak version. \n As we know a lot of people have disorders like Broca’s Aphasia. They still can think clearly, but are unable to form connect sentences and the structure of their sentences make often no sense. That means, that the strong version is not true. The brain is complex, and there a seperate brain areas for thinking and language. Everything is connected, but that does not mean, when we cannot speak well, we are not able to think. Although, the brain area like Broca’s area, who produces speech may be impaired, still we can think und understand. \n People often tend to say what they think and we get know what they think about the world, so for some extent it influences our thoughts. But sometimes people have problem to find the right words. \n Evidence was found for the weak version in the grue language. People do not distinguish between blue and green. In an experiment they had to distinguish between the colours blue and green. They distinguish them, due to different hue. \n So for some extent language can influence our thoughts. But our thoughts are influenced by more than one factor. Our experience, emotion and enviorment determines also our thoughts. You cannot reduce only to language.

Antwoord: Whorf’s strong language theory says that in order to think, language is needed. In other words: no languge equals no thinking. The weak hypothesis says that if a language has more ways to describe something, we can think in more sophiastic ways. \n I do not agree with the strong whorfian hypothesis, because I don’t think that language alway determines thinking. There are many occasions where language cannot describe thoughts, for example emotions or taste. Furthermore people with a nonfluent aphasia are not able to talk, but that does not mean that they don’t have thoughts/are not able to think. In most cases they actually do think and they don’t realize that the words coming out of their mouth are not making any sense. \n I do agree with the weak hypothesis. One proof for that hypothesis is that in some languages there are many different names for colours, e.g. a different name for each type of blue. So people that speak these languages are also more likely to differentiate between different blue colours. \n\n Summarizing I do not agree with the strong whorfian hypothesis, but I do agree with the weak whorfian hypothesis.

Antwoord: The (Sapir-)Whorfian Theory is seperated in two variations/types: There is a weak and a strong theory of it. In the strong theory, it is said that language determines or defines our thinking. This theory, in the modern view, is less supported by researchers. Reason for this are for example that there are thoughts, which can not be described by words and there are processes that are independent from language: smell, emotions and metal images work without language. \n\n The weak theory is, like it is already included in the formulation itself, a weaker version of the language theory of Whorf. It says that language influences our thoughts, behavior etc.. This version is more supported by the modern view and there are a lot of examples that proof this theory. In some populations, for example, the people do not have words as “left” or “right”. They basically just describe directions by “North, west, east, south”. This populations show (in comparison to populations, who have “left” and “right” in their language) more orientation skills and higher orientating abilities. Another example is a study made between Dutch people and Jahair people. Jahair people have specific definitions for each smell. In comparison to the dutch people, who were often giving undefined definitions of the smell, Jahair people were able to find a clear term for every smell that was presented to them. \n Concluded, you can see that the weak theory has more scientific support. Although there is also support against the weak as well as strong Whorfian hypothesis. Some people claim, that boths language and thinking is both a result of the environment, that each population lives in.

Another example comes from a tribe that has more than 2 kinds of “numbres” few and many thus never where able to use algebra for example and show decreased capacities in this stuff. \n\n In addition you can have indescribable thought and feelings this tackles the strong variation of the theory.

Antwoord: The (Sapir-)Whorfian Hypothesis concerns the relationship (between number of words in a) language and the thinking of the speaker. \n The strong variation states, that language limits thought, which would mean that one cannot think of something that is not labelled by a word. \n There are several arguments against this variation because there are no concrete words for some feelings, emotions or smells, but you can still think about them. \n The weak variation states that language facilitates thought. In conclusion: if a language has more refined terms for a concept, then you can also think about it in a more sophisticated way. One (not entirely) true example for that is the Inuit language, which has more (defined) words for different kinds of snow. According to the weak Whorfian hypothesis this would also allow them to think about snow in a more refined way. \n But still, even if a language does not have a lot of well defined words for one concepts, one can describe it and therefore think about it, which speaks against the Whorfian hypothesis.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory involves two different theories which explain the correlation between language and thinking. The first theory is called the strong theory. This theory attempts to demonstrate that for conceptualizing or understanding relationships in the world we need words in our language which explain certain things. This theory refers to the term that language influences our cognition. This theory also seems to reveal the aspect that without language we wouldn’t be able to think. It also prevent us from perceiving the world appropriately. \n The second theory is called the weak theory. A majority of people support the weak theory because it seems to be more realistic. The weak theory attempts to demonstrate that the more words we know the better we are able to perceive the world in a better way when we know more words. The reason why most people support the weak theory is because we as humans are also independently able to think without language. Mental images, emotions, feelings involve thinking without language.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory proceeds on the concept that the people with different language can have different pattern of thinking as well as learning. According to him, language is the base to determine the level of cognition. For example: More complicated and varied a language, more the intelligence. \n\n To be more descriptive, we can assume that there is a certain tribe where the different color orientation is missing. For example: the might have word ‘Red’ for all other variance of colors including brown, maroon, orange unlike the terms seperate for each color in English. This show, that English people are more creative or high in cognition than those natives. \n\n However, there is both strong & weak variations of the theory. While it’s true that the development of language may somewhat alter our perception or creativity, it is unlikely that it determines your Intellegence level. For example: The same tribe may have more than dozen words for several other words, which in English might be presented by a single word phenomenon. Thus, this theory cannot be totally relied on.

This theory claim that the language have a influence on the culture. \n But it is possible to claim the exact contrary; if their is peoples with more than one undred word to describe the snow it may be because they have been exposed frequently to this type of weather. Moreover it is not because the germans have the same word for “speech” and “discuss” that they are unable to make the difference between both terms.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s languge theory has two parts. \n The weak one says that the more syphisticated ways, concepts your language has, the more syphisticated one is able to think. \n The strong one says that the language actually limits our thoughts. \n Most scientist agree on the weak one but disagree on the strong on. \n I think the strong one is not a really good hypothesis as for example in German there is a word for “language” and “speech” (Sprache) still people who are German and learn english, also if they don’t learn it are able to distinguish the meanings of this words, which shows that the language can not be the border to our thinking. (Strong hypothesis) On the other hand the weak hypothesis could be possible, if we can combine elements of our languge in a lot of diffrent ways we maybe would also be able to think/structure our thoughts in more/different ways. Beeing used to combine e.g. different words, will maybe help us to combine our thoughts in more syphisticated ways.

Antwoord: This theory is about language and thought. Whorf argues that people’s thought are made out of language and therefor thought is limited to the language. \n Weak: - language influences what people can think of. \n - language influences how people discriminate all kinds of things (color/numbers) \n Strong: - people can only conceptualize things when their language has a word for it. \n - discrimination between small differences (hues) is dependent on whether those discriminations can be told apart THROUGH language. \n\n example: a native tribe in Maleysia only has words for 1 and 2 (in counting) more than 2 is translated as “many”. When people of these tribes learned to count, it showed that it was incredibly hard for them to estimate or calculate (strong) \n\n example: An other country in Asia had a specific word for “smell of blood that attracts tigers” when the smell was presented to these people they all gave the same word to describ it. And since there is no translative word for this in the western world, descriptions of this smell was for nearly everyone very different. (strong) ? there is no word in english language to describe this so people are failing to recognize this smell!

Antwoord: weak form: The greater our vocabulary of a laguage, the more sophisticated can our thoughts be. If we know a great amount of words, we are able to use a greater variety of words to think or to express our thoughts. \n strong form: Our thoughts are limited by our vocabulary of a language. We cannot have sophisticated thoughts if we don’t know a great amount  of words. Language defines our thoughts. \n\n Most experts do only agree with the weak form of the theory. They criticize that the strong form doesn’t take into account that visual imagery, some emotions, and smells are not dependent on language. Therefore, only because you don’t know a great amount of vocabularies, doesn’t necessarily mean that you are stupid.

Antwoord: There are two different variations of the Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis. \n The first one is the weak one: It says that the more words and the broader the grammar of a language is the more sophisticated and precise are the expressions made in this language \n The second one is the strong variation of the whorf’s language theory: It says that language limits our thoughts. This means if your language is not good you can’t be intelligent. \n\n In general the w. theory is about language and its influence on our thoughts. So that maybe people from different countries experience the same things different because of their language difference.

Antwoord: The strong Whorfian hypothesis states that (our) language limits us in how and what we think. This means that our thoughts are directed by the language we speak and that we can only think in a way that our language ‘allows’ us to. The weak Whorfian hypothesis states that when a language has many descriptions about certain concepts, we can think in a more sophisticated way. \n Most scientist support the weak Whorfian hypothesis. \n\n I support the weak Whorfian hypothesis, because I think that when your language offers you a vast description of a concept, only then you are able to think in a more sophisticated way. \n Why I don’t support the strong Whorfian hypothesis is because I am of the opinion that culture and your environment is the main aspects which can limit us in how and what we think. I believe that we are ‘primed’ by our culture. I agree that language plays a role in here as well, but I don’t think, that you for example are not able to think in a way that an Indian speaking person is thinking, only because you are not Indian speaking.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis states that language determines thinking and thoughts. The modern view favors the weak one, so that a rich language can lead to more complex thoughts and conclusions. This is plausible, as a large vocabulary means having more expressions available to aid when forming a conclusion or a judgement. Simply the fact of speaking more than one languge can lead to a different perspective of thinking, as some languages have a different way of phrasing sentences than others do, and so people might be able to adopt a different perspective based on the language the person is speaking. The strong hypothesis states that without language, one would not be able to think at all. This might be true, as language delivers words to express thoughts and being consciously aware of the thinking process. However, one would still be able to think though, as thinking alone rather depends on the environment or the mind itself than just the ability to form words and sentences. Complex thoughts might not be possible, but simple associations seem to be plausible.

Antwoord: The Whorfian theory tries to draw a link between language and thinking. \n The strong variante is without any evidence and that is why she is highly unreliable and nobody supports this variante anymore. However, the strong variante states that our language dictates our thoughts and this is based on lingustic determinism. So language determines our thoughts and limits our way of thinking. \n\n The weak variante is based on linguistic relativity and says that language facilitates our thoughts. This means that when you have a rich vocabulary, you are able to refine your thoughts and express them in more sophisticated manners. As we know, these are other modalities like our smell or emotions that are able to influence our way of thinking without any words. And everyone knows that it is quiet challenging sometimes to find the right words or how to write down things despite the fact that we know what we are thinking. Additionally, for this variante there is evidence. Let’s think about the gruel language, people who not distinguish between blue and green, but are also able to separate blue from green chips just in another way than we (e.g. brightness). There is another language that as no more numbers than three, but when you would ask a man with four children, he knows that he has “many” children and can name them and therefore he can think about it but express his thoughts just in other way.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory says that we are influenced in our thinking by our use of Language. \n So if we are for example struggling with a specific problem, paraphrasing the question could sometimes lead to an other perspective / way of thinking, which helps us to solve the problem. This weak variation of the theory is generally accepted within the scientific society but there is also stronger more controversial form of the theory. \n This variation claims that our talking guards our thinking, so if we say; “I do not like Peter” we start thinking this is true. The problem with this theory is, that there are many examples where this is not true. \n So let me sum up with one last hypothetic story: \n If your wife asks you, if she looks beautiful in her strange pink barbie dress you are maybe so polite to answer with a yes. Nevertheless you still know that it is not true. Therefore your thinking is in this case not influenced by your talking, and you can conclude that the strong variation of Whorf’s language theory is not true.

We use mostly words to think and our thoughts cannot go beyond the language. We use mostly words to think and our thoughts cannot go beyond the language. \ The weak includes that language supports our thinking. So, it’s the basis of thoughts. \n The strong one is a little difficult, because there are some aspects that contradict this variation: \n There are thoughts that don’t include words, like smell mental imagery & emotions. Moreover, people learn new languages. Does that mean that they can think differently? I don’t think so. At least, I don’t feel differently, or think differently after learning English for example. The strong one means that someone who is not able to speak appropriately is not able to think. So, what about deaf-mutes? They do think. There are many aspects, where thoughts don’t necessarily need language. \n The weak variation, however, can be supported by the fact that we definitely often use words in our thoughts. So, language can be seen as a supporter of our thoughts and as basis. Still, our thoughts are not limited by language.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis says that our language influences our thoughts. And not the other way around. “The limits of our language define the limits of our world” as the german poet Eichendorff once wrote down, would be a sentence that represents the strong variation of this hypothesis. However, the weak form nowerdays is more convinient among linguistics. \n The weak form of this hypothesis admits the correlation between the quality of language and thoughts, but also points out exeptions. For example the germans have a word in their language which can not be found in other languages, “Fingerspitzengefühl”, it expresses one’s ability to be very precise and well organized/cautious while working/operation with his/her finger-(tips). But the fact that only the german language has an own expression for that does not mean that germans are better defining who is a cautious/precise person with his/her hands/fingers or not. The fact that thoughts can be non-verbal as well rejects the claim of the strong form of the hypothesis. The dutch dutch word “gezellig” alone does also not make dutch people more friendly or cautious about their social environment.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about the relationship of language and cognition. The strong variation, proposed for example by Wittgenstein, proposes that language determines our thinking. \n Potential contra arguments are, that there are multiple nonverbal ways of thinking, for example mental imagery, and the fact that language develops also when needed. (as in: for example new words emerge, as new technique arrive and somebody had to think about for example the computer, before there was even a word for it.), so the thought can also preceed language. The weak variation of Whorf’s language theory proposes therefore that language does not have an effect on cognition in a way that if a language has a most sophisticated way of saying something, one can not think of it in a more sophisticated way. So in this variation, language does not determine, but effect thought.

You have difficulties in explaining the colour to a stranger, because your idea of colour is different from others. \n\n The strong theory is about that having extra words for example scent describing you can express yourself much more efficient and better. So in this case if you have extra words for scents it can positively influence your thinking. So in this theory language really provides the ability of thinking.

Antwoord: The Whorfian languge theory states that the languge one person speaks such as his mother language influences his thoughts. The thoughts about the same thing among people speaking two languges will therefore be different. \n It can be divided into the weak variation called linguistic relativity and the strong version called lingustic deteminism. \n In lingustic relativism the language influences the thoughts someone has. Therefore for someone dark colors can constitute the inside of the rainbow and for someone else the darker colors constites the outside of the rainbow. Language so to speak influences our thoughts. \n In lingustic determinism the languge someone speaks determines his thought and his view on the world. Language so to speak limits and controls our thinking. Therefore someone who is speaking a very complex languge should be able to think more complex than someone who speaks a less complex languge. Inuits for example have several words for the thikness of ice, more than for example Germans, regarding Whorf, Inuits could think more complex than Germans. \n Modern scientists agree on the weak but not on the strong hypothesis.

Antwoord: The whorfian language theory states that the language that we speak and its associated vocabulary directly influences our thinking. This means that language is seen as the shaper and former of our ideas and thoughts. The theory includes that if we have a big vocabulary about snow, we will also be able in our thoughts to clearly distinguish different types of snow if we have an according word for it. This part of the theory has proven by research to be false however. The most spread and mostly accepted variant of the version is the weak one among researchers. This states that language is the most sophisticated way to think about a matter and in highest detail. It allows thinking outside of language to be possible like thoughts based on smell, imagery or emotions. This is not the case in the strong variant of the theory. Here it is believed that we can only think based on language and what is in our vocabulary.

It basically has two types of argumentation, a weak one and a strong one. \n The weak variation supposes that you can only think in variations of a language, meaning that different language might have different names for colors, e.g.: While we distinguish between green and yellow, there is an Indian tribe which has only one name for both colors, meaning it is hard for them to give names for both colors because there is only one in their language. All in all, the weak variant supposes that you are kind of retrained in your thinking by your languages and cannot think in a more sophisticated way than your language allows you to. \n The strong version of the theory claims that language determines completely our thinking, meaning that we can only think about something we can express in our language. \n Nowadays, the strong version is basically proven wrong, and most scholars agree with the weak version of the theory.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that language is essential for the execution of thinking processes and therefore sets the boundaries for our variation of thoughts. \n The strong variation of this theory claims that without words for a certain phenomenon in our language, we aren’t capable to think about this phenomenon. This means that individuals speaking a language which includes a huge variety of words and more specifications, are able of far more sufficicated thinking processes than individuals with restricted language skills. \n On the other hand is the weak variation of the Whorfian theory which acknowledges the fact that there are situations or feelings that they can’t be thought about and that language doesn’t necessarily limit our thinking. For example a study with Inuits was hypothesized to show that Inuits, with more than 40 words for ‘snow’, would be able to make more specific destinctions about snow’s consistency than regular English-speaking people. But instead they found that Inuits weren’t more expertised than the English-speaking people which shows that even a variety of specific words don’t make someone’s thinking more elaborate than others.

This is why there is a weak and strong variation of this theory. \n I personally think that language only influences our thinking slightly. I think that our thinking is influenced by language, because of the age and situation we learn it in. Due to those factors there are different associations to certain words which leads to different thinking. For example, it could be much easier to swear in a language you learned as a teenager than in your first language, which you learned since you were an infant. The reason for this would be that one is much more used to swearing as a teenager than as a small child.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory can currently be divided into two versions. \n Also known as the strong Whorfian hypothesis, this version claims, that we can only think what we are able to put into words. However, research has shown that thoughts do not need to be expressed in words to exist and be formed, for example in people with psychological conditiones which make them unable to read, speak or hear, can still form thoughts at the same level of healthy people. \n Because of these findings, science, and not even the founder himself, believe in this version of the hypothesis anymore. \n Nevertheless, effects of language on thinking have been shown in some native american tribes who only count to two in their language, and are therefore not able to distinguish between groups of higher than two, but can still name all their six wifes. \n As a result, a more modern version of the given language theory is the weak version, still claiming a relation between language and the ability to express something in words, but does not claim that language is the one and definite limiting factor to thinking and the forming of thoughts.

Antwoord: This theory discusses the influence of language on thinking. \n The weak form of Whorf’s language theory states that the more elaborate our language is, the more refined are our thoughts. There are for example native tribes which don’t have such a numeric system as we (Western cultures) have. Therfore, we can assume that they can’t solve that complex mathematical problems as we can. However, it appears to be enough to fulfill their needs. And on the other hand, they might have much more distinct words to describe certain smells which would be impossible for us to state in English. \n The strong form of this theory states that language limits our thoughts. If we don’t have the word for something, than we can’t think about it. Or more drastically said, people who can’t speak are not ask to think and are therefore stupid because there is nothing going on in their brain. \n However, most scholars don’t agree on the strong variation because it is too drastic. Most scholars agree on the weak form instead. Since there are just some feelings, thoughts, smells etc. which can’t be expressed in words, but we are ask to think about them. \n Or, imagine there is a genius having a very intelligent theory in his mind, but also he will struggle to bring his idea on paper at the beginning. However, that doesn’t mean that he is stupid. \n Therefore, there is not enough support for the strong variation and more for the weak variation. That’s why the weak variation should be favoured nowadays!

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory says that our language / knowledge of language influences the way we think or are able to think about something. \n In the strong variation it is said that, if there is no word for a certain thing in the language, a native speaker of this language is unable to think about it. Though, this variation does not include things like thinking in mental images, recognising scents without naming them etc. \n The weak variation says that one is unable to think about something in more sophisticated ways, if this person has no word for that ‘something’. An example would be the Inuit, who have many different words for ‘snow’ and thus recognise different types of snow faster and easier, whereas our knowledge (and thoughts) are limited; we only have one word and don’t differentiate that much.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is a statement about the influence of language on thought. According to the strong version, language does not only influence the way we think, it even determines and limits our thoughts. This expresses the statement that someone who is not able to speak, is not able to think. Although thinking is a part of intelligence, this version states that people who are not able to speak (or speak badly) are even more dumb than other people. This version is less accepted in the world of science. Because of other influences (e.g. emotion) on thought, which are not part of language, the weak hypothesis is more confirmed. \n\n The weak hypothesis states that language influences the way of thinking. Thoughts are expressed by words and thinking is even done with language. Therefore (speaking another language leads) to another way of thinking which also results in different languages. Consequently, one is not able to understand the way someone else thinks if he speaks another language. \n In conclusion, one can say that language forms our way of thinking and furthermore leads to a distinction in the way of thinking.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory says that language influences our thinking rather than the other way around. To this theory there are different viewing point. \n The first viewing point is the strong variation, which totally agrees with the statement of this theory. However, this variation is not possible because evidence proofed that it cannot always be the case that language rather influences the thinking. The weak variation is the other point of view, which says that this theory isn’t right at all. But also for this view there is evidence that it actually could be possible that the theory is right in some way. \n So the most logical point of view is the variation of both point of views because as evidence showed, it cannot always be the case, but evidence also showed that it can be true. An example for that was found in Scandinavia, where people have about seven different words for kind of snow which actually caused a better or more specific perception of snow. Another example is a native population that makes verbally no difference between green and blue. They can distinguish the shade, like we do it with dark red or light red, but these shades are not different colours for them. They might also be “light x” and “dark x” whereas we would call it “green” and “blue”.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is a theory that questions the role of language in thinking. According to the strong version of this theory: one cannot think without language. So if one is unable to use language, he/she is also unable to think. \n According to the weak version of this theory; language is not the only factor needed for thinking. This version suggests that thinking is also influenced by other factors like emotion for example. \n\n The weak version of Whorf’s language theory is more supported by scientists than the strong version.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory has a strong and a weak variation. The strong one says that our thinking is limited to our speech. So our brain can only process and think about things, that we can express in speech. This theory is already highly rejected even by Whorf himself. For example researchers already found tribes where numbers or even directions do not exist in their language. They still can express or know what is left and right. The weak variations says that language makes thinking easier. Here is the example the Inuit which have many words for snow, so they can differ a lot more. However, its shows that english has actually also many variations.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory suggests that all individuals are suceptible to learning a language. As infants, humans are able to pick up on sounds and vowels in language’s. Learning and thinking through patterns is how individuals are able to learn a language. The learning of a language is not done by imitation of the parents but by using different patterns to create words and sentences. Strong variations are individuals who learn a second language and thus are more prone to understanding the patterns and rules of a language allowing them to learn and understand a language quicker.

Antwoord: The Whorfian language theory states that the language one speaks influence the way we think. Some languages have different expressions than others, and some have more words or phrases to describe certain concepts than others. An example of this would be with native indians in the americas, who had several words to describe snow. Other cultures, e.g some culture in Africa only have 2 words for describing colors, light or dark. The different words for snow in the previously mentioned culture refers to the texture of the snow when it hit the ground. In strong variations of the theory, these differences in language would make the native indians (or eskimos) better at distinguishing between different types of snow, simply due to the fact that the differences of the types of snow are in their language. The culture with only 2 different words to describe color would thus be worse at distuinguishing between colors, as they didn’t have all words for the different colors in their language. There are some people who discard this hypothesis, but there are many, who instead of accepting the hypothesis fully, they instead adopt weak variations of it, which states that language doesn’t completely dictate how we think, althought in certain cases it might have an influence. People who speak a language with only 2 words for color, light and dark are still able to distinguish between e.g. orange and red.

The more complex the language the more complex the thinking. \n\n A weak Whorf’s language theory says that just because we have more words to describe certain complex structures we are NOT able to think more complex. This is the view over modern scholars. Effidence for this weak theory comes from the fact that we are also able to think in images, smells or emotions.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis is a theory linking language to an individual’s thinking ability. It’s strong version, otherwise known as linguistic determinism, states that if one does not have the words in his language vocabulary for something, then they cannot perceive and think about it at all. In other words that language is the limit of our thinking ability. This view has now been overulled and modern theorists agree with the weak version. This version states that language definately shapes the way we perceive and think rather than language being the absolute limit of our thinking ability

Antwoord: The worf’s language theory: \n The worf’s language theory explains the relationship between language and thoughts. It says that language determines our thoughts. The strong variation tells us that if our language or the context of the things what we speak or tell other people isn’t intelektual or important and difficult than we have only stupid thoughts and aren’t smart at all. The weak variation of this theory says that language is the way to express our thought so language can limit our thoughts. \n So the strong variation of this theory isn’t true for people who have linguistic problems like Brocka’s aphasia. if you have Brocka’s aphasia then your brain has a damage in the Brocka’s area which is important for speech production. If you have problems to express your thought in words this doesn’t mean that your htoughts are stupid or not smart. You only have problems to express your thoughts. This would be an example for the weak variation that the strong variation isn’t completely right. But also thoughts can limit or influence your language. Wernicke’s aphasia would ben an example for that. There you have promblens to comprehend thinks, but no problems in producing speech.

Antwoord: The weak variation of the theory implies that language influences our thinking. This theory is approved by multiple scientists because it had been proven by multiple experiments and it in common situations. For example if someone yells “fire!” then the  reaction of people hearing it will be panic and anxiousness. The hard version implies that thinking is limited by language. For example, inuits can distinguish between over 100 types of snow because they have expressions for every type. Also, when Mayan people are shown an arrangement of objects in a row, and have to reconstruct the row after turning 180 degrees, they arrange the objects according to north, east, south and west instead of left to right, which leads to an opposite alignment. The cause is that they have no words for left and right. Still, this theory has to be discussed, because there could be other reasons. For example, English people actually have more expressions related to snow so the first point is not completely valid. Second it is possible that Mayan people understand the task differently and if you explain it right then they align the objects exactly as European people. In the end the hard version can’t always work because lots of thought is not expressed by words for example mental images.

Antwoord: The Whorfian Hypothesis is about how one’s knowledge of his or her motherlanguage affects his or her possibility to think. Whorf devides his hypothesis into a strong and a weak version. “Strong” means, that the cognitive ability to think is limited by language, so if you do not have the words for something, after this hypothesis, you can not think of it. However, this theory has to be criticyzed due to the fact, that there is empirical evidence of languageless thinking, for example thinking in pictures. Additionally, after this theory, it would mean that animals, who do not use language, are not able to think. \n The weak variation of the Whorfian Hypothesis does not state that thinking is limited by language as in the previously discussed variation, it rather says that the possibility to make use of higher complex language structures also supports the possibility to have higher complex thoughts. \n To conclude, you can say that the weak Hypothesis is more plausible, due to the fact, that it does not deny the existance of other important features of thinking while it gives an insight how thinking is supported by language.

Antwoord: The weak form of the Worfian’s language theory indicates that if there are several ways and synonyms in language to e.g. describe a certain concept, you are also able to think in a more sophisticated way. The strong form of the theory claims that language limits our thinking. Modern language scientists reject the strong form of the theory, but agree with the weak one. One reason is that there are several thinking processes which we cannot verbalize well, but which are very complex, for example our sensation of smell or emotions and feelings. In these cases our vocabulary is not sufficient for expressing our thoughts which is the opposite case of what the strong form of Whorfian’s theory says.

Antwoord: The (Sapir-)Whorfian theory of language deals with the relationship of language and thought. \n In the weak form, which is still accepted by most scholars, the theory states that languge influences the way we think, and if one speaks a more sophisticated language, he or she can also think in more sophisticated ways. The influence of language on thinking and problem solving can be demonstrated for instance with giving speakers of Mayan languages, who think in east, west, north and south, and speakers of most European languages, who think in left and right, the same spatial task. Almost all participants will be able to solve the task, but will intuitively chose two different ways. \n The strong form of the theory, however is less accepted by modern science. It states that language not only influences, but determines our way of thinking. \n This can be falsified for instance, by the fact that both Mayan, and European participants in the spatial task were able to perform the task in the other way very easily, once told how it works. \n Another example is the English distinction between ‘language’ and ‘speech’, both of which are expressed by German ‘Sprache’. This does not mean that German people do not distinguish the two, the distinction is just context based. On top of that, thinking involves many other mental representations next to language. \n In conclusion, language does influence, and facilitate thinking, but it does not determine how ‘sophisticated’ we can think. Instead both thinking and language are much more influenced by culture.

It says that language limits our thoughts that we cannot beyond the borders of language. \n\n I agree with the weak variation, because in most of the case we do really think in words and it gives us the opportunity to express this. Some people say reading a book gives you better abilitys in language exams for example, because you are better equipped with words! So you can express your thoughts more precise. \n\n But I do not agree with the strong variation, because we can also think beyond borders of language.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory, named after Benjamin Whorf, states that language and words define our cognition and the concepts we are able to think of. Language influences us and also defines our way of thinking. There are two variations of the theory, the first and weak variation says that if our language is set up broader, we are also able to think broader and think about complex situations. Language therefore defines our cognition. One example are the inuits which have supposedly a lot more words for snow, falling snow, slush ice, snow in all kinds of variation. So they are able to think of much more concepts of snow than we do. Opponents of this theory explained that it makes sense that they have different words as they need it for their daily life. A later study also explained that we actually have even more english words in our language that the inuits. \n The strong variations of the theory, which has a lot more believers than the weak one states, that language restricts our thinking. For example there is a word in german called “Schadenfreude”, which basically means you make fun of something who experienced something embarrassing. There is no word of this term in the english language, so they are restricted in their thinking.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is about the connection between our thinking and our language. The weak version of the theory indicates that dependent on how defined our language is, we think in more defined terms. So, for example Whorf stated the language of Eskimos. The Eskimos have very much terms for snow, more then e.g. the german language or, as he hypothesised, the english language. So Eskimos are, in comparison to Germans, more capable to think about the word snow in different ways. With this version, most of the modern language researchers agree. \n The strong version of the theory simply indicates, that we are only thinking in form of language.

Language helps to define thoughts or describe some mental processes but it is not the only basis to knowledge like the strong variation states. \n Today most linguists agree with the weak Whorfian hypothesis.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states, that thinking processes differ based on the language somebody is speaking and the country somebody is living in. A strong variation of this theory relates to the necessary differences in speech and language. For example, people who are living in very cold regions (Arctic) perhaps need more words for snow than people in europe do, still that does not mean that their thinking processes differ. Weak variations to Whorf’s language theory are based to many studies that have investigated the language understanding behavior of new born babies. If they heard friendly voices (not in their native language) they were happy for example, if they heard unfriendly voices they started to cry. Language and thinking is based on much more than just the ‘hearing’ and ‘speaking’ aspects. For example, there are deaf human who never learned different languages and still able to communicate with each other. Thinking is based on knowledge and as John Locke said: “our knowledge is too limited to understand the whole world.” In Addition, thinking is related to the environment somebody growed up in as well. Many children are based bilingual. All in all it can be concluded that Whorf’s language theory is worth thinking about it because of course language influence our behavior and perhaps our thougts as well (“I am a complete different person while speaking french”) but as already said are there many different aspects that influence our thinking as well.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory has two variations. A strong and a weak theory. The weak theory states that all mental processes can be expressed in form of language. The bigger and more improved one’s lingual inventory is, the more mental pocesses you can express. The strong language theory states that language is limited, not everything can be expressed with language. Ludwig Wittgenstein was a supporter of the strong theory. On the one hand language can constantly improve and expand itself due to more precised descriptions of phenomena, on the other hand are there descriptions never objective. You never know whether your’e description of a specific phenomena is accurate or not. And that is the edge of language because you cannot constently invent words, your’e expression has to relate to a already existing language. And every language is limited to a certain degree. This is any support for the strong language theory of Whorf.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory hypothesizes that our native language determines or influences how we think because the language determines how well we can express ourselfes and in how much detail and complexity we can think. This is the strong variation of the theory. However, most scholars agree upon the weak variation of the Whorf’s language theory, which means that they believe that one’s native language influences one’s thinking but not their ability or complexity to think. For example, when showing a picture of a walking person to native English and native German speakers and asking them to describe what they see, it is normal for an English speaker to say that the person is just walking, whereas Germans would also name a direction or a goal towards which the person is walking. \n The reason for this is, that in the German language it is not common to say that a person is simply walking, but usually you also say where the person is going. In this way a person’s thinking is influenced by their native language.

Antwoord: No one would disagree with the claim that language and thinking interact in a significant way. \n The link between these two components is the central aspect which is discussed in the Whorfian hypotheses. This theory includes two variations. \n The first one is called the strong view which includes the linguistic determinism. \n An example for that is that in the Solomon-island, there they have a high bond with coconuts and therefore nine different words for coconut (each expressing a different state of growth), where in contrast the USA has only one. \n After the linguistic determinism the people on the Solomon island may way better think about coconuts, so language limits your ability to think. You can not think beyond the boarder of languge. \n The linguistic relativity furthermore states that language influences the way we perceive the world. In an asian culture for instance there is a word called ‘Leo’ which stands for respect for the elderly. In the USA there is the word respect, the word elderly, and the concept that you should respect your elderlys, but no seperatet word. Does this mean that the asian culture respect the elderly more and therefore have a explicit word for it, or do they have first the word and therefore respect their elderly more? This chicken-or-egg question is quite impossible to answer, we only know that in this asian culture the respect for elderly is very important. This leads to the weak variant of the Whorfian hypotheses. \n Supporter argues that there are several forms of thoughts, which are independent of language. Emotions, feeling, mental imagery or thoughts we simply can not write down. So language can help to think. The better your language distinguishes between aspects and the better you speak your language may help to have ‘better’ thoughts. For example, if you have a high biologically vocabulary, your ability to solve difficult envioremently problems increases. \n Finally, to get a real idea in which extent language can influence our ability to think, a nonlinguistic experiment would be an idea. In a between-subject design different individuals act as different cultures from the world have to solve as fast as possible different non-linguistic tasks. A comparison of the means could help us to get knowledge about this elementary question.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that language slows down our thinking. \n\n It is divided into three variations, the strong, the weak and the moderate possibility for the theory to be true. \n In the strong one language is not suffiecent enough to be able to express our thoughts. For example the word ‘Fingerspitzengefühl’ only exists in German but in no other language. It discribes the idea that you have a certain feeling in your fingers, literall translation which means that you have a certain ability to do something with a certain intuition. By trying to explain what the word “Fingerspitzengefühl” means, and the problem resulting from not really finding the right words for it, is proof for the strong variation of the theory. I know - I think what it is, but describing it with words or in general language is difficult and slows the process of thinking down, if not complety makes it impossible to explain your thoughts. The weak variation states that sometime we do have different words or different amount of words available in a language, for example we have several variations for the color blue, but that doesn’t mean the can’t describe what they think and see. An Inuit tribe has several words for snow, to discribe the snow, we only have one word for snow but we use multiple adjectives to compensate.

Antwoord: The Whorfian theory is devided into a weak and a strong hypothesis. the strong variation declares, that the language you speak determines the thought you can think, so for example, if you speak Dutch you can only think “Dutch” thoughts, so you would not be able to understand English thoughts, because they would follow a different principle of thinking. The weak variation says the same, but also declares, that not all thoughts are expressed through language, but also through gesture, body language, symbols and many more, explaining why it is sometimes hard to express thoughts through language. \n Taking everything into account, I’m in favour of the weak variation of the Whorfian theory, because it makes much more sense and is build up more logically.

Antwoord: The weak form of Whorf’s language theory states that the language that we know influences the way we’re thinking. More concrete, if the language and words we know are limited for some concepts, we can not think in more sophisticated ways for that concepts. This weak form of the theory is still approved by modern experts, contrary to the strong form. The strong variation of Whorf’s language theory states that language limitates our thinking. So, basically, that we can only think of something if we know the word that belongs to that concept. This strong variation is not approved by modern experts, because there are many parts of thinking that are independent of language. To give some examples: \n mental imagery, smell, feelings, emotions.

Antwoord: The Whorf theory of language states that our thinking is influenced by or language we speak. \n The strong Worf’s language theory says that our thinking is determinde by our language, and everything we cant put into language we cant think of, we dont even perceive it. \n The weak Worf’s language theory states that the language we speak and the words we have can make us more or less sensible to something. It influences the way we think and perceive the world. \n For example a tribe in africa does not distinguish between blue and green, when they performed a task they were slower in distinguishing different shapes of blue or green, while a european peformed this task faster. It doesnt mean that they have a different color vision they see the same way everyone does. Today’s scients state that the strong Whorf’s theory is unlikely because we can think in way’s we dont need language for, for example mental imagin, or our emotions. Language is more likely to shape the way we perceive and think of something in terms of being sensible to it.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory (also called Whorfian hypothesis) proposes that the language one speaks determines or highly influences the thoughts one can think or the saliency of different categories of thoughts. That means that you are able to think, what you are also able to express with words. Furthermore, Whorf proposes that language is not just a way of expressing our thoughts in words. He claims that language shapes our thoughts and that language can be seen as a guide for our thoughts. \n If we have a rich vocabulary, we can make strong variations of our thoughts and we are able to make finer distinctions in our thoughts. Whereas with poor vocabulary we can’t make that fine distinctions, we have only weak variations of thoughts and our thoughts are limited as the language is limited. \n The current approach is not fully in line with Whorfian’s hypothesis. Today we think that humans develop their vocabulary depending on their environment they are living in. Instead of language shaping thoughts, it is said that language is shaped by environment.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is the proposal that language makes thoughts and that our perception of the world and the way we put our thoughts in a concepts depends on the language one speaks. Modern psychologists tend to believe more in the weak variation of that theory which states that, even though language influences the way we describe things, we are able to think in non-language ways. Our language influences heavily or determines our thoughts and saliency how we put our thoughts into concepts but this may also be also be a part which is influenced by the culture we live in more than the language we speak. \n The strong variation of that theory states that language influences our thoughts completely and that we are not able to think in a more sophisticated way than we speak, that language determines thoughts.

Antwoord: the Whorfian language theory basicly states that language influences our thinking. the modern day experts have 3 levels of agreeing: \n\n disagree \n\n partially agree. (weak variation) which basically means that language does affect our thinking in some way but not completely. \n this is the most supported variant \n\n completely agree (strong variation)\n this would mean that because Germans have the word fingerspitzengefuhl, (which means that you’re very precise) they would be better at recognizing a precise person than us.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states, that the environment in which we learn strongly influences our understanding and usage of language, which is considered the strong variation of the theory and that language influences our understanding of the world around us, which is considered the weak variation of the theory. According to Whorf’s theory the way we perceive the world is dependent on our language, for example the concept of time. This theory has some merrits especially regarding concepts and knowledge of different aspects of our lifes but their is much more to understanding our surrounding than just language, like emotions which cannot always be described in words.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about how language influences our thoughts. The weak theory says that language facilitates our thoughts that when we speak in more sophisticated ways, we can also think in those ways. The strong theory says that language determines our thoughts. For example this theory supports the claim the differences in culture result from the differences in language. Thinking is probably influenced in how we speak, but in my opinion thinking is much more than just language. For example language doesn’t influence the way we see, smell or taste things. On the other side there are words in one language that don’t excist in another one. The word “gezellig” in Dutch does neither exist in German nor in English. In the dictionary it’s translated in words that are similar, but don’t mean the same. Before I moved to the Netherlands I didn’t know that word and it’s a feeling that I can’t express in my mothertongue. Therefore I would say that Whorf’s language theory is right, but I would only support the weak variation, because there are still thoughts that aren’t influenced by language.

Antwoord: The Whorfian theory comes in two variations; \n\n 1. The strong Whorfian theory; indicates that our thinking is determined by our language. It says that we can only think what we can express in words and the other way around. According to the strong Whorfian theory, people who can’t speak (very good) would be stupid. \n Another example for the strong Whorfian theory would be, that in the german language, there is no word for ‘umami’ (? the taste of protein in f.ex milk, meat…). According to the strong theory, germans wouldn’t be able to think about or even mention this kind of taste, which is obviously wrong. From today’s point of view there is no evidence for the strong Whorfian theory. \n\n 2. The weak variantion of the Whorfian theory indicates that our thinking is influenced by our language, but doesn’t determine it. An example for it is the ‘grue’-language, whose speakers don’t distinguish the colors blue and green. If you would give them a staple of blue coins and green coins they would still order them in two categories as what we describe as ‘blue’ and ‘green’, using other indicators (hue, saturation ..). Just because they don’t use the words blue & green, doesn’t mean they don’t distinguish these two stimuli/experiences. Another example is the languge of eskimos, they have multiple words for ‘snow’ which makes them more sensitive towards that stimuli. Most language-experts believe in the weak version of the Whorfian theory.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that meaning is percieved differently in each different language. Sometimes we do not have enough vocabulary to describe an object in another language because perhaps that language lacks the terms. \n Another language might have different terms for the word “love” or “snow” but English recognizes only one term (name). \n The strong and weak variations of the theory are that this theory makes each language unique but also hard to translate and also difficult to learn or even understand.

Antwoord: The Whorf language theory says in general that language (words as well as grammar) have a huge influence on a persons perception and ability to explain the world. \n The theory is split into two different versions. The weak variation of the theory suggests that we are influenced by our language in a big manor. For example when there is no word for a certain taste it takes us a lot of effort to perceive it. One example for that would be the taste Umami (describing a strong taste of protein) commonly used in the japanese language. If that word is unknown to a person after the weak variation of Whorf’s language theory it is hard to define that tast. We would be able to describe it with words known to us and ultimatively learn the meaning and associate a complex meaning to it. \n The strong variation of the theory suggests that our language actually restricts us to the words we know and their definition. When looking at tastes once again that theory suggests that if a taste is unknown to us we are not able to taste it because we don’t seem to be able to make a mental representation of something we don’t have a word for. For example some tribes have names for different smells of blood that attract tigers or not and while they are able to distinguish these smells as well as name them we are not able to do or learn that because of our restriction in language. \n Whorf’s language theory in its weak variation has more support from experts of the matter while there are fewer supporting the strong variation of the theory.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory consists of two different variations. There is the strong and the weak variation. The strong variation means that language fully dettermines or constrains a beings life, that means that if you do not have a language you do not have an answer. So people without a language with a big vocabulary are less intelligent then people with a language that has for everything a different term. In modern days this theory is not used any longer, whereas the weak variation is still common. \n Here language is an important factor for living, but it does not fully determines or constrains life. A good example for that is the grue-languages, where the word blue and/or green is grue. Two things that are very different from each other (with a different meaning) the same word, therefore when people talk they can not fully describe what they are meaning.

Antwoord: The Whorfian-hypothesis, or also the Sapir-whorfian-hypothesis, states that an individuals thoughts are limited by his native language. \n\n The strong variation states that you can only think, what is possible in your native language’s grammar and words. Therefore it would be impossible to translate textes correctly, and every culture, with its own language, his own thoughts that are not available for people from a culture with another language. \n But this seems to be illogically if you consider that you can also think in terms of images, emotions and numbers. \n Therefore the weak variation of the hypothesis is more likely that states, that we try to express the thoughts we had in our native language, and the way we structure or thoughts depends on our native language’s grammar. But in the weak variation it is still possible to convert the same thought from one language to another.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about the ability of language and it’s skills concluding the level of intelligence. \n Whorf states that the language-level depents on ones intelligence The strong variation would be if we take this theory and compare them to children. Children from 12-months start using words to express their feelings and communicate, but there is no clear syntax because the communication is expressed by 1 word phrases. With increasing intelligence, the language leven increases as well because our ability to express ourselves and share our thoughts, emotions, needs and attitude by using language leads to the conclusion that with increasing intelligence, our language skills increase as well. Still, this does not state that stupid people are not able to use language. They can use language and they are able to use the needed syntax form, but they don’t have the same language skills as intelligent people and can therefore not express themselves as good as intelligent people.

Antwoord: According to Whorf’s language theory does the extent of language with it’s extensive items, grammar and expressions determine the way we think. According to him a very complet language with many sophisticated details makes a more complex thinking possible. In contrast, a less complex form of language would only allow a less complex form of thinking. The weak version of this theory would be, that language influences the way we think. The strong version additionally would say, that language determines the way we think, or more specific, the way we are able to think.

Antwoord: There are two versions of the whorfian language theory. \n\n The strong version, also called language determinism, claims that if someone has no word for something, he also has no concept for it. The importance of language can not be emphasised enough according to this theory. Language determines the way humans think in a total way. For this theory, there is little to know evidence and not even Whorf or Sapir claims that this strong version is true. \n\n The weak version or language relativity theory claims that language is an important thing but not all dominating like in the strong version. \n The language influences how people act and think, but just because someone has no word for something, it does not mean that he or she has also no concept for it. \n There is lots of evidence for this weak version. \n There are for example natural tribes in Papua-Newguinea which have a word for 1 and a word for numbers higher that 1. If someone has for example 4 kids and is asked how much children he has, he uses the word for “more than 1”. But if he is asked to draw lines in the sand. The result looks like this ||||.

Antwoord: Whorfian hypothesis states that the language you speak can influence how you think and behave. \n Strong Whorfian hypothesis (aka language determinism) states that language determines thought to the point that thought is dictated by the language you speak. For example, Benjamin Whorf wrongly reported that the Hopi people could not understand the concept of time because they did not have any words for it. This has since been debunked, as there is now proof that though different cultures may have specific words they can be translated to other languages using phrases or examples to describe the phenomena. Another arguement against is that non-verbal people or people with damage to their language centres (Broca’s or Wernicke’s aphasia) are still capable of thought. If strong Whorfian hypothesis was true then languages would not be translatable. This form of the hypothesis is largely rejected by modern science. Weak Whorfian hypothesis states that language can enhance thought (aka language relativity). This form of the hypothesis is largely accepted, as we can prove that how certain cultures express thoughts through language can affect how they interact with tasks, for example some Mayan cultures say “east” and “west” instead of “left” and “right” and that changes how they first approach spatial tasks, but the task can be further explained through extended language to reach a universal understanding. It is also accepted that when we extend our vocabulary we are able to expand our thought and make it more complex and detailed. \n Another point is that language can influence our behaviour and memory through the misinformation effect where (eg.) leading questions can cause us to remember events differently than they actually occurred, further evidence for the weak Whorfian hypothesis.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory consists of a strong and a weak variation of the theory. The weak theory assumes that the language someone speaks determines the way someone thinks. This means for example that if someone speaks a language which involves many well defined concepts, the person is better able to express what she is thinking. An example for that would be the language of Eskimo’s which involves 20 different words for “snow” so they are more able to define what exactly they want to express about snow than someone speaking a language with less-defined concepts about snow. An other example is a tribe in Amazonia which uses the “two-or-many” concept which means that they use “many” to describe any amount above two. In the German language we use more numbers and are therefore able to better express (better = more defined) amounts. The strong theory assumes that language limits our thinking and when you are not able to speak, you are not able to think. This strong theory is not supported by many theorists in contrast to the weak theory. This is due to the fact that there are also thinking processes which doesn’t need language like feelings and emotions.

Antwoord: The sapir-whorfian theory describes the relationship between language and think. More specifically, the weak sapir-whorfian theory claims that language is associated with/has an influence on thinking in a way that the structure and categorization of language influences ways of thinking. To give an example: the categorization and discrimination of colors is influenced by how colors are described in language in a way, for example, that a vast amount of words for colors in a more sophisticated categorization and discrimination (as part of the thinking process) leads. \n The strong sapir-whorfian theory claims that language determines how and what we think (so this is determination of thinking, not merley influencing!) It is said, for example, that you cannot think about and understand a concept when you do not have a word for it. In addition perception depends on languge. \n Nowadays, language-experts accept the weak but not the strong sapir-whorfian theory. It is argued that differences in thinking are not due to language but more to social and environmental influences and context effects.

Antwoord: The Whorfian’s weak variation of the theory says, that language helps us to define our thoughts more specifically. This means, that we use language to think more specific about something. In contrast, the strong variation of the theory says, that language determines our thoughts. Means, that we can only think when we have language, otherwise we are unable to think. Language experts rely on the weak variation, because it is known, that thinking relies on more than just language. Thinking involves also mental imaginery, feelings and emotions. This show, that humans can also think without having a language. And language just helps us to make our thoughts more specific. Evidence for the weak variation is, for example, about a group that does not have numbers over the digit 3. An old man is asked, how many grandchildren he has. He couldn’t say how many he had, but he said their names. He just doesn’t have the language for answering this question easily, but through saying their names, he showed, that he thought about them. This is an evidence for the weak variations, which kind of rules the strong one out!

Antwoord: The strong theory of Whorf’s hypothesis describes language as the determining factor for cognitions. (linguistic determinism) \n Without a language cognitive processes wouldn’t be possible. If someone never learnd the words to describe a certain concept he won’t be able to understand nor perceive or discriminat it, e.g. if a child grows up without the word for sky it won’t be able (after the strong Hypothesis) to discriminate the sky from the earth or understand the concept of it all. This Hypothesis is widely known to be wrong \n\n The weak form of Whorf’s Hypothesis states that language has an influence and restrictions on certain cognitive processes but it does not determine cognition. If someone doesn’t know the word to describe a concept it will be hard to think about it. The other way around, the more sophisticated words and concepts a language has the more sophisticated thinking about those ideas/concepts is possible. \n If a child grows up without the word sky it will be hard for it to understand the concept of flying but by far not impossible.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that the language we speak influences how we think. \n The strong whorfian hypothesis states that our thinking fully depends on the language we speak and thus that if we do not have words for something, we also cannot think about it. Opponents argue that it is possible to have thoughts that simply cannot be expressed in language and developed in the weak whorfian hypothesis, which claims that the language we speak does not determine our thinking, but that it can have influences on how we think: Expressing something linguistically faciliates thinking. Evidence for the weak whorfian hypothesis can for example be found in the Jahai smell distinction: Jahai people can distinguish between a wide range of scents, we don’t even recognize because they also have much more words for these scents. In contrast, people from a Mayan tribe with no more counting words than ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘many’ have found to be bad at calculating even after they had been taught our number and calculation system. \n These examples support the weak Whorfian hypothesis, but the fact that we for example can have thoughts or feelings that we cannot fully express counteracts the strong whorfian hypothesis.

Antwoord: The Worfian hypothesis states that language is determined or extremely in how a individual can think. /n For example some cultures have a lot of different words in how to describe smel. \n The Worfian hypotesis has a weak and a strong variation. \n The weak states, if we have a lot of detail in words in our language we can think in a more detailed way. \n The strong hypothesis states that languge determined our thoughts. \n I think the weak theory is more suitable for the way we think because if we have more words for example for smell we can better distinguish between it. If we don’t have so much detailt or describing words we are unable to discribe what we experience. So I would say we can also think about somethink we can not name, for example a difference in smell, because we can distinguish a new smell we don’t know and think about it, even though we don’t know how to discribe this new smel, so it would speak against the strong hypothesis that we can only think about something what we can name, or wherefore we have a word.

Antwoord: the Whorfian language theory contains the connection between language and thinking. It assesses both points in both kinds of theories. The strong Whorfian language theory says that the language influences our thinking in the way that it influences how we think and what. There was an example given with mens of a stamm in Africa which can not count more than three so if somebody asked them about a number above three they cannot tell, but is it than that they also don’t know about the numbers because they are that much influenced by there language? Recently research found out that the strong Whorfian language theory does not fit for the most cases but the weak Whorfian language theory does. The weak Whorfian language theory says that the thinking is not shaped by the language but it’s influenced by it, it says that language differences, like in example with Inuit, who can define more than two kinds of snow, thinking is defined through language, also the circumstances play an important role in influencing the thinking. \n The main difference between the strong and the weak Whorfian Hypothesis is than in the strong theory language shapes thinking and in the weak Whorfian language theory it influences the thinking, more in defining.

It is probably more that the environment and culture influence language thinking. \n Another thing is that there is a language that has no words for thime, like “before”. But they do talk about different things in another way and they have the general understanding of time. \n Dani people only have two words to describe color, but I think they do perceive the same colors as English people do. \n The strong variation definately doesn’t have evidence, for example there are some words in a language that are expressed totally different, but nevertheless they mean the same things and everyone knows what it is for. \n The weaker variation might have some truth in it, due to the fact that I as a German, for example, often don’t understand English puns.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory exists out of two parts. The strong Whorf’s language theory says that language determines or limits our thinking which means in different words that if you can not speak you can not be smart. \n the weak variation of the theory says that language influences our thinking which means if you know a lot of words you can define your thoughts in a better way. Most scientists aggree with the weak variation of the theory! When we think we think in words but there are several forms of thinking which are idependent like smell and feelings.

Antwoord: Whorf developed a theory (with some input from his mentor) that language affects our way of thinking. He developed two variants of this theory, the strong variant and the week one (which he was a proponent of). The strong theory states that language shapes our thoughts and actions. This variant is such that language can be used to utterly control a person’s actions. this variant is often seen as being too extreme, and so the weaker variant is more closely observed. This variant states that language can have an minor influence on an individual’s thoughts and behaviour. A proponent for this theory is that there are certain tribes where 3 numbers exist 0, 1 and many (or in others 0, 1, 2 and many). Likewise in some places blue and green are observed as the same colour and described in such a manner. These examples show that the way of speaking can influence how someone thinks, although this is to a limited extent.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is that language cause an effect on thinking. For example, when we call “snow” in English, it is unique word. However, people who live in North-polar area (Eskimo), they have several words to call “snow”. \n So, suppose there is a word A. in B language. People who speak B language have special thought about A (word). However people who cannot speak B language, have no idea about A (word), they even don’t have concept of the word “A”. \n Through this example, we can learn about strong variation of the theory. \n On the other hands, people who cannot speak B language can learn the concept of term “A” by learning B language or experience some happening which is related to term “A”. It is the weak variation of the theory.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about the connection between language and our thinking abilities. \n The weak variation states that we have ‘linguistic relativity” where, language facilitates thinking and so, guides us to a manner of thinking. An example would be, when a language has more words for a color, native speakers of that language will think about e.g. a rainbow differently, and they will distinguish the colors for which they have more terms. This is reflected by diffent, non linguistic brain activitiy when they observer colors. \n\n The strong variation states that language determines the boundaries of our thinking, and thus determins our world view (linguistic determinism). An example would be the Inuit’s, who have very many different terms for different kinds of snow, and they have higher ‘snow intelligence’ than we will ever have.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that language influences the way people think. \n There are aspects to support his theory and on the other hand aspects that question his opinion. One example for supporting his argumentation are the differences in different titeling of colours in different languages. For instance there exist two different words for blue in Russian. One for light blue and one for dark blue. This would be an example for the weak variation. In addition tribes who never use numbers exist. \n These differences are crucial and influence the way someone thinks about certain things. \n The strong variation of Whorf’s language theory states that language influences cultures. \n On the other hand it can be said that people who grow up bilingual obviously have the same opinion on something no matter in which of their language they say it out loud. \n Although there are different viewpoints on Whorf’s language theory I come to the conclusion that he was right. The language we speak is a reflection of our culture which means that language influences the way we think.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory basically says that the language the one speaks determines or strongly influences what the other thinks. There is a strong and a weak variation of the theory and modern scientists prefer to stick to the weak variation. \n The weak variation says that concepts for which you have a word can be more easily distinguished (remembered etc.). So perceptual discrimination is better when you have a word for specific categories. An example for this is an experiment which was conducted with English-speakers and Mexicans. The task was to say whether the showed colour was blue or green. Eventhough the Mexicans have the same word for blue and green, 50% of the Mexican participants were still able to distinguish (almost every English-speaking participant did the task correctly). The strong variation says that you can only conceptualize things when your language has a word for it. So perceptual discrimination depends on language. An example for this is the language of the Jahai in Malaysia who distinguish smell more precisely than e.g. Europeans. They have a word for the smell of blood of a tiger for example. This has the function to recognize danger and keep safety.

You don’t need language to have or to think about a feeling. You can feel good or bad without the need of language for it. \n It also says that people that have a different native language than you could not understand your thinking in the way you do. \n One example is that people in Germany do have more different words for ‘snow’ than people in Spain, which leads to a different way of thinking and understanding thoughts. \n Most scientists ‘vote’ for the weak theory of the Sapir-Whorf theory.

Antwoord: The Whorfian language theory says, in its weak variation, that language influences thinking, perception and behavior in general. Examples are that certain tribes like the Inuit have several words for the color of white and as a result are able to perceive more “varieties” of white than e.g. english-speaking populations, who only know the one word for white. Another example are people that use vulgar or agressive language. According to the weak variation of this theory people tend to act more agressive after they adapt agressive language. \n The strong variation of the Whorfian theory says that language basically equals intelligence. So people that can express themselves or verbalize better are therefore more intelligent. Among other weaknesses one of the biggest ones might be handicapped people, with e.g. language disorders such as aphasia, intelligence of those affected people cannot simply be conducted by their linguistic abilities, and the strong variation is not very well received.

The weak hypothesis states the more words a language has for a specific topic the easier is it to talk about this topic. For example the Inuit have about fifty different words for snow. Therefore they should be able to speak about snow in a more detailed way than someone who is trying to express himself in english. \n In contrast the strong hypothesis states that our language limitates how we think. So you can’t think about something you don’t have a word for. \n The most modern languages support the weak hypothesis. The more words you have for a topic the easier it is to talk about a topic without adding additional context to explain what you mean. Another example would be, in German is just one word for language. In english is a split into language and speech and it is therefore easier to understand what the other is talking about.

Language would be the cause of cultural differences such as time view, according to this view. \n\n A weak variation of the Whorf’s language theory is that language does hold restrictions on how we think, but not so much that languages determines how we think. According to this theory, cultural differences such as perception of sounds (sound is high or low, or in other cultur: sound is thick or thin) are not so different in the way we process these sounds. So according to this theory: language gives different names to situatons or objects, but in our mind, the processing of these situations or objects is the same. \n\n Or, differences in sound discriptions (soud is high or low, other cultur: thick or thin), actually cause us to among cultures, hear sounds differently.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory states that the language in which you speak and your way of thinking are directly related. The weak variation of the theory proposes that when you use a sophisticated language with a large lexicon and many complex words and definitions available to you, you can also think in more sophisticated ways. \n The strong variation, however, proposes that the language you use directly limits the way you think, so that you can only think in the words available to you, and in no other way or more sophisticated form. \n Many language specialists agree with the weak version of the theory, but not the strong one. \n I agree with them, as there are many forms of thinking available to us that do not require words, such as analog representation or mental imagery, thinking of a smell or sound, et cetera. \n This means that we are not limited to the words in our language, which opposes the statement of the strong version of the theory. \n However, language does enable us to think in complex and sophisticated ways, due to the many definitions and concepts available to us through words, which supports the weak variation of the theory.

Antwoord: The Whorfian hypothesis makes an assumption about the relation between language and the ability of perception and can be divided into a weak and a strong form. \n According to the weak form of the hypothesis language enables us to think in more sophisticated ways as we expand our vocabulary and have more refined descriptions of our concepts. At the same time it limits us as we can not express concepts that reach beyond the borders of our own vocabulary. \n The second form of the Whorfian hypothesis makes a more stronger distinction claiming that language limits us in the way how we perceive. According to this strong form the ability of perception of a concept is limited by the language one has for that concept. \n Critics take distance from that second form of the hypothesis arguing that the limits language sets to expressing a concepts does not affect its perception. Therefore having a very well refined description of a concept is strongly influenced by the person’s environment and needs, but does not mean that people in a different environment are not able to perceive these descriptions. Instead they simply have no need for such a refined discrimination in terms of their environmental surrounding.

Antwoord: Whorf’s hypothesis states that language determines thoughts and that language is necessary to think. Moreover he says that people speaking different languages think differently. \n The strong variation of the theory is defined by language determinism which means that language determines thoughts and linguistic structure determines cognitive structure. Whorf gives examples like the many words for snow in the language of Eskimos, the timeless concepts of Hopi language and the different color terms in many languages which all determine the thoughts of people differently. \n Many psychologists cannot support the strong version and found evidence against it. For example they showed that Eskimos do not have more words for snow than other languages, Hopi is not a timeless language and people suffering brain damage or aphasia are still able to think. \n This is why a weak version of the hypothesis was set up, which revers to language relativity. It says that our thoughts are not only determined by language but are also shaped by our emotions and non-verbal behavior. Many psychologist can support the weak variation of the theory but there is still a lot of debate about this version.

Antwoord: The weak version of Whorf’s language theory says that when a language contains several words for specific concepts, then these concepts can be described in a more sophisticated way. The strong version of this theory mostly shaped by Wittgenstein is that language limits our thinking, so if we don’t know the word for something we cannot even think about it. The weak version of Whorf’s language theory explains, for instance, why inuits in Alaska can think of snow in more complex ways than Europeans do because they have several words describing the for us just called “snow”. However, the inuits have also more experience with snow, for example how sticky or fluffy it is. Following the strong version of Whorf’s language theory we Europeans couldn’t even think of different types of snow because we don’t know any other word than “snow”. People arguing against Wittgenstein’s theory, however, claim that you can think of different types of snow, for example, when you touch it. One can feel the difference and thus think about it. \n There is no exact conclusion, if Whorf’s language theory is totally right or not. Even among scientists there is no complete answer. There are some scientists supporting the weak variation of the theory and a greater part that is at least partly against it.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about the relationship between language and thinking. The underlying question is how much the verbal capacity to express oneself limits the capacity to think in abstract ways. \n Indeed there  is empirical evidence for just that, in the way that a more refined ability of verbal expression is correlated to more differenciated ways of thinking - supporting the weak variation of the theory stating just that. \n The strong variation of Whorf’s language theory is more controversial. In its strong form, it is accurately describable with Wittgenstein’s “the limits of my language are the limits of my world”, meaning that thoughts neccesarily require a verbalisation in order to be thought in the first place. \n It is evidently easier to subscribe to the weaker version of the theory because it doesn’t have to apply to less complex thoughts like “I am hungry”; in the stronger variation one has to distinguish between different types of experiences, such as thought or feeling or mood etcetera. \n Both variations however give a plausible cause for the covariation of language and thoughts, which until now is observed only in humans to this degree. The strong variation can also be applied to the realm of philosophy, as Wittgenstein’s works so impressively prove.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory makes a statement about the influence of beeing able to express a thought, a feeling, an observation or naming an object in relation to the actual perception or awareness of those. \n The strong variation indicates that if a language has no word/expression for a thing/feeling etc. it is therefore not able to be aware of it at all. \n The weak hypothesis in contrast states that an individual can be aware of a feeling or percept an object even though it might not have a word/expression for it in it’s language. \n An example would be the father of four children in a native tribe which language has only words for the numbers one, two and three. \n According to the strong hypothesis the father then should not be aware of having more than three children when asked by somebody about how many children he has. Observation has shown differently and therefore today’s opinion tends to prefer the weak Whorfian hypothesis because the father actually replies “many”. So he is aware of himself having more than the in his language expressable number of three children. He just has no specific word for it.

Antwoord: The Sapir Whorfian theory refers to the importance of language for thinking. \n The weak theory states that language faciliates thinking, because the better you are in expressing yourself in words and language, the more complicated and complex you can think. \n Many psychologists agree with that theory but oppose the strong theory, that states, that people would not be able to think without language: Language dictates thinking. \n The problem with the strong theory is, that it would exclude the fact that we can think without language, but mental images, emotions and feelings can’t be put in words but are felt, though. So the strong theory is wrong. \n Language is universal, because there is universal grammar, each culture has lexica, prosa and poetry and similar vowels. \n There is a hierarchical structure which starts with a sentence, then phrases, then words, then morphemes and then phonemes. Specifically the syntax, gives meaning to this whole sentence and structure and so language can faciliate thinking, because it includes meaning and is universal and complex. \n To conclude it can be said, that the weak Whorfian theory is true because language facilitates thinking, but the strong Whorfian theory is wrong, because it states that language dictates thinking, but thinking about emotions and mental images is also possible without language. So the strong theory is not true.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory says that if we don’t have the language or the words for something we aren’t able to think about it. There are two variations on the theory the first one is a bit broader and the second one states that you need to know the words for something if you want to think about it if you can’t do that than you can’t think about it. The second theory is not common anrymore because other scientist showed some examples that even if you don’t know words for something you can think of it for example a mental image of something. That’s why Whorf’s second hypothesis is weaker than the first stronger one because scientist have another view about the second hypothesis now.

Antwoord: According to the Whorf’s language theory the language one speaks determines the way one thinks. The strong variation of the theory is that language determines cognition so you cannot think about something you don’t have a word for. According to the weak variation, language just influences your thinking. Today most people agree with the weak variation of Whorf’s language theory. People who are suffering from Aphasia show that the strong variation is most likely to be wrong. Eventhough they might not be able to find words and to product speech (Broca’s), they are still able to think. \n Also, several tests showed that eventhough some cultures might have the same word for green and blue, these are still able to distinguish between them, so think about them as well. Other tests are supporting the weak hypothesis, namely that it is easier for people to distinguish between different types of smell for example when when you have the words for it.

Antwoord: The Whorfians Hypothesis demonstrates, how language and thinking are linked and how they possibly influence each other. \n The weak version of it claims, that language facilitates thinking. If we have a very broad vocabulary, than we are able to give a refined expression of our thoughts. \n The strong version states, that language determines or limits thinking. We are not able to think, if we don’t have the words for our thoughts. \n\n Most researchers agree upon the weak version of the Whorf’s language theory and so would I. \n According to the strong version, only language enables us to have thoughts. However, even if we don’t have words to express smells, mental imagery or certain feelings, we can think of them in different ways. Some studies show, that even though some tribes have a variety of different vocabulary to describe smell, people from western cultures are equally well in distinguishing between different smells, although they don’t have words for these differences. \n\n I’d consider language as a vehicle for thinking. It enables us to communicate thoughts and can help organize our thoughts. But it doesn’t set boundaries to our thoughts, because thinking precedes language.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory deals with the question in how far language influences our thinking. The strong theory proposes that you can only think what you can also express - your ability of speaking limits your ability of thinking. When you have a very limited knowledge of language and know only a few words, you cannot think further than these words reach. When you know e.g. only a few basic terms concerning music, you won’t be able to think about anything else related to music. \n The weak variation of this theory proposes more or less the opposite; thinking creates language. For example, children that cannot hear and are not exposed to any sign language will create their own language to communicate and express their thoughts. But if there are a lot of variations of words, for example the many snow-related terms of the Inuit, you will be likely to only think in these terms that you know - or, as a non-inuit speaker, think in the terms that your language has, for snow and not make up more, that would resemble the different types of snow as the Inuit do.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is a link between language and thinking. \n The strong hypothesis states that language determines our thinking. \n According to this hypothesis, we are only able to think what we are also able to phrase with language (or to speak out). \n This hypothesis is not accepted by many experts. The modern hypothesis is the weak variation of the theory. \n The weak hypothesis says that language only influences the way people think. \n We are able to think about a certain topic in more sophisticated ways, if the language we speak is well defined about this topic. \n An example for this is that in case we have lots of vocabulary for the topic ‘snow’, we are able to think about snow in more sophisticated ways. \n Many experts agree with the weak, but not with the strong variation of Whorf’s language theory.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is the Whorphian hypothesis. The Whorphian hypothesis discussed the relationship between thinking and language. There are two variations, the strong variation and the weak variation. The strong variation hypothesises that our language is the boundary for our thinking, our language limits us in our thinking, we cannot think more than we can speak. The weak variation of this hypothesis suggests that if our language, the way we are able to describe certain things, is more refined, then our thinking is more sophisticated. Modern language experts do not agree with the strong variation, however there is some evidence that the weak variation holds some truth.

Antwoord: The Whorf’s language theory is based on the hypothesis that language shapes character, behaviour and limits of thinking. \n\n A strong aspect of the theory would be, for example, that languages with a stronger pattern of talking ‘future-related’, will more likely have native speakers that are concerned about future investigations that native speakers of languages that do not show a similar future related tense. So on the strong side of this hypothesis, you can conclude that those people would be better in saving money. \n\n A weaker aspect would be, for example, that languages that use the masculine form of referring to general things more than the feminine form influences a discrimination of males and females. \n This aspect is considered weak because in those languages the masculine form is simply shorter and seen as the ‘general’ way of referring to, for example, a group, instead of developing actually stronger discriminations between genders for native speakers of that language (e.g. German).

Antwoord: Whorfian’s Theory of language predicts that our language influences or determines our thoughts and how we think. \n In the weak variation it is said that a more detailed language leads to a more detailed ability of thinking with other words when you have more words and details in your language, you can also think more detailed. The strong variation states that the language not only influences our thinking but that our thoughts and thinking is determined by language. \n I don’t agree with this theory, because I think that it’s not about the production of speech that influences our thoughts and gives us the ability to think but more the comprehension of speech that we need \n If I think of Steven Hawking who lost with the time the total ability to speak it show me that a person who is not able to speak, is still able to think in a way most people who can speak are not. \n There must be something else that determines or influences our thoughts and our capacity to think.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory explains the relationship between language and thoughts. Two variations, the strong and the weak variation, exist for this theory. The strong variation states, that you can just think until the borders of you language, so if your language has for example 3 ways to describe the color blue, you can’t think of more than this three ways to distinguish different tones of blue. This was also shown by a research, in which people from a tribe in Namibia were shown blue and green pictures. In their language they don’t distinguish between blue and green (it just exists one word for both colors), so they couldn’t see a difference between these colors. The weak variation states, that you can think in a more sophisticated way, when you have a bigger vocabulary. When you have more words to distinguish a color or an object from another, you have a more precise way of thinking, because you can really get into detail imagining something/thinking about somehting. \n Whorf’s language theory does not include mental imagery and thoughts about emotions. \n To me Whorf’s theory really makes sense and is evidence for differences in perception between cultures with different languages, as stated in the example with the Namibian tribe. \n It also explains that children have an easier way of thinking than adults, because they have a much smaller vocabulary and as they grow up it gets bigger every day, leading to a more precise way of thinking and expressing themselves.

Antwoord: The Whorfian theory means, that language influences thinking. \n The strong version is, that you can not think about something, if you do not have a word for it. \n For example, when you can just count to three and you are in a library. In a library are more than three books, but, anyhow, you would say and think that there are three books, because you do not have another word for, lets say, 2000 books. \n That does not seem to be true and that is why we have the weak form of the Whorfian theory This version says, that you can think about something, when you do not have a word for it, but you can not express it in words. Back to the library example, you would know, that there are more than three books in the library, but you could not know how many books there are, because you do not have a word for 2000. That is why you would say, there are more than three books, what is not very clear and that is why language influences your thoughts. \n Another example would be, that in Germany, you do have a word for if you feel good, because something bad happened to someone. You say “Schadenfreude”. In English, you do not have this word, but that does not mean, that you can not feel it.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is the Sapir Whorfian’s theory. This theory means that language is essential for thinking. Without language it would not be possible for us to think about things that have a meaning. Therefore our thoughts would be meaningless. \n There are strong and weak variations of this theory that are caused by different cultures which speak different languages. A more complex language would therefore determine the thoughts complexity. In the german language, for example, there are a few words for snow to describe the snow. You then can think about different types of snow. In other languages ther may not be different words for snows, which leads the people to not to think about different types of snow, but only about snow.

Antwoord: The Whorfian language theory is a theory that tries to explain the relationship between language and thinking (capacity). It is divided into a strong and weak version. The strong version of the theory claims, that language represents our limits of think. This indicates that people that are better in speaking, e.g. have a broader vocabulary are silmultaneously smarter/think in more complex ways. The weak version of the theory claims, that people with a wider set of language are able to present their thoughts in a more refined way. \n The strong version of the theory is, in my opinion, far from reality. You cannot measure intelligence/complexity of thoughts by mere language, e.g in mathematics, where logic plays the biggest role words do not play a big role, which is contradictory to the strong version of the theory. Whereas the weak version does sound possible. If you for example look at introspection, people that know a lot of words are able to describe their thoughts more in detail, just because they have the tool for it. Lastly this discussion is also present in the modern view of the Whorfian hypothesis as the strong version is mostly declined but the weak version is considered possible.

Antwoord: Whorf’s language theory is about how the language we use might influence and shape our lives. It’s based on how people around the world use different languages and how for example the inuit people have many different words to describe snow. Does this fact make them different somehow? According to a strong variation of this theory: Yes, language shapes one’s mind or influences it very strongly. \n\n It can be argued, that strong variation of this theory overrides the influence of culture, or at least tries to explain those kind of things which are more based on differences between cultures. The weak variation of Whorf’s theory tries more to scale down these implications. In the end language does have great importance in one’s life and different kind of languages might shape one’s mind and brain’s neural activity to some direction. For example Finnish language declines some words in hundreds of different ways, when English really doesn’t. Weak variation of Whorf’s theory could argue that that really has some impact to brain.

Antwoord: The whorfian hypothesis adresses the relation of language and thinking. The strong variation of this history proposes, that the boundaries of thinking are determined by language. The weak variation states, that a broader net of knowledge can (!) lead to more sophisticated ways of thinking. This can easily be demonstraded by the word ‘snow’. Eskimos have around 60 different words for snow, some tribes in the african sahara have none. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the concept snow in case of the Eskimos, allthough it is up to discussion if the african tribe can not think of snow because they have no word for it. Today it is the weak variation of the whorfian hypothesis which is considered to be better proven. Not only language determines thinking, but for example mental imagenary or emotions.

Antwoord: The strong variation of Whorf’s language theory is that language dictates cognition, in that your first language limits the way you think and interpret the world, and that your understanding is limited by the vocabulary you know and can therefore use to convey information. \n The weak variation of Whorf’s language theory is that the way we think, behave and interpret the world is influenced by our first language, and that we are able to understand unfamiliar concepts as long as our categories of vocabulary extend to accomodate similar words, phrases or ideas. \n\n An example is being shown a picture of a woman in a parking lot and being asked what she’s doing. In English, a person says she’s walking. In German, the word would translate to “walking to her car”. Because German words have the action and goal incorporated, it is difficult to translate to a one-word answer in English due to different grammatical rules. According to the strong variation, Germans look for a goal to the action before responding, whereas native English speakers simple state the action. According to the weak variation, a native German speaker can explain the concept of a goal-directed action to a native English speaker and it will be understood, because goal-directed actions exist in English but as sentences rather than word.

That means that we can only think within the capacity of our language skills and knowledge. \n One could distinguish people and their possibilities of thinking by looking at their amount of vocabulary knowledge. This version would also lead to differences in the thinking capacity of people from different countries with different languages. \n So that people from one country would not be able to think in the same way as people from another country. \n\n The weak variation of the theory states that the language facilitates thinking. In the way that language helps us to think in more complex ways, or in certain ways but one is able to think beyond of the boundaries of language. \n In this variation people from different countries might think in different ways, shaped by their culture, but one person of one country would be able to understand the thinking processes of a person from another country. \n\n Example. English has two words “speech” and “language” which are translated to just one word in German “Sprache” but despite this fact, Germans are still able to distinguish between the meanings of “speech” and “language”.

In the strong variation of the theory it says that language influences and therefore also affect thinking in a way that for example there is a difference between the english amount of words composed to the Inuit’s language amount of words concerning the expression “snow” which leads to a better distinction between the description and understanding. After investigating, this claim couldn’t be prooved, so researchers agree more with the weaker variation of the theory, which says that language can have a relatively influence on thinking. For example, in some cultures there is a difference between a color, like lighter blue and darker blue. Therefore language can give a more detailed impression and changes our thoughts in a more detailed way.

Antwoord: Whorf claimed that a language a person speaks shapes their thoughts and behaviours. The strong variation of the theory is that, it is a fact that language is required and is the base of a person’s thoughts and feelings, and how they are expressed is determined by what language they speak. For example, the Inuits have a range of vocabularies for the word related to “snow.” This allows a person who speaks that language to think about and communicate extensively on matters related to snow. This would be not possible for a person who speaks a language with limited vocabularies on the term “snow”, therefore their thougts and perspectives on the world and weather, in particular, varies from a person of the Inuit origin. \n The weak variation of this theory is that there is a limit to how much a language can shape a person. It has been argued that a person cannot be shaped entirely by their language, and there are many other factors that plays a role in a person’s development. The argument with the Inuit language with the term “snow” has also been countered by the fact that English has even more variations for the word, and that the Inuits simply has many variations due to the fact that the environment they live in required them to have variation in the term for more effective communication.

Antwoord: When talking about the Whorfian’s hypothesis one first has to point out that it deals with the link between language and thinking. There are two different variants of the hypothesis: a strong and a weak one. \n The strong one states that our thoughts are determined by our language, meaning that you could - for example - draw conclusions about somebody’s thoughts just by listening to him (to what he is saying). Most of the linguistic and psychological experts disagree with the strong variant as it ignores other influences like mental images, smell or feelings. \n In contrast, the weak variant suggests that when a language contains many refined descriptions of concrete concepts, then you are also able to think in even more sophisticated ways (like mentioned above). Most of the experts do agree with this weak variant of the Whorfian’s hypothesis. In the weak form it is thus suggested that languages facilitates thinking. One can conclude that the influence of language on thinking in the weak form is “weaker” than as it is stated in the “strong” version.
